Welcome %user% to %system%!

This email was sent to you because of your interest to join our
social community. We are very happy to have you with us and hope our
little world is to your liking.

Below you will find 3 things. The first is the username you requested.
This is your alias on the talker and the name you will go by. The second
is your password. The password was generated at random just for your use.
 You may change this password once you get online by typing:
         .password <my_new_password>
 Do NOT type the <>'s

Thirdly, you will find our user agreement. Read it over and make sure you
understand the small things we ask of you. If you can't abide by these
simple guidelines, we understand, and your account will be expired
automatically in 1 day. 

If you do agree to them, make sure you return with your username and
password in 1 day or your account will be lost.

Thank you,
%system%'s staff
