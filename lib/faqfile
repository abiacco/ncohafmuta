                   ^HRPinWHeeLs - Frequently Asked Question v1.2^
                        
1. ^HGWhat is this place?^

PinWHeeLs is a relaxing atmosphere to, well, relax! :) The theme is based 
on an idea my friends came up with when they were lagging really bad on 
a talker one day. It was cute, so we adopted it for this talker.  It does 
not mean that people here can only complain about lag :P It also doesn't 
mean that we never have lag, we do (Hey, we're only human :P). All decent
subjects all welcome. We are not a mud, mush, muse, moo, OR irc. We are 
called a talker or chatline. WE do not have any goals, adventures, scores, 
violence, hit points, objects, or anything like that.

2. ^HGWho runs this place?^
 
Cygnus is the owner, coder, maintainer of files and stuff.
Cygnus's e-mail is ncohafmuta@asteroid-b612.org

3. ^HRI need help!^^HG What do I do?^

If you are a new user here, type --> .h new
If you need general help, the .h command gives you a list of commands and
if you type .h <topic> you will get specific info. on a topic. If that 
doesn't help you, you may want to type .wiz to see what wizards are on
that can help you. You can also send an SOS to all wizzes by typing 
something like --> .sos I need help!

4. ^HGHow do ranks/levels progress?^

Ranks go in this order...Everyone starts out as a "Newbie". Once 
you are a bit familiar with the commands, you can promote yourself
to "Wheeler" by setting your desc, profile (entpro) and gender.
The next levels are Wizard, Manager, and Admin.

5. ^HGHow do I get promoted?^

One of the most frequently asked questions, but a different response than 
most. Here at PW we don't follow the "Don't ask us, We'll ask you" policy.
If you think you are experienced, know your commands real well and like 
to help out regardless of your rank, first read --> .h levels and then just
ask. We don't mind. However, hassling wizards about promotions will hinder
your chances and if taken too far (asking after you've been asked not to
ask anymore) may result in a *demotion*, so use your common sense :)
Promotion from Newbie to Wheeler can be done automatically by setting
your desc, profile (entpro) and gender.

6. ^HGWhat does .fight do?^

Fight is a command that lets you fight another user, in sort of a cartoonish
style. It's pretty funnny. to challenge a user, type --> .fight <user>
that user will then be given the option to accept or decline with 
--> .fight yes|no  If no, the fight is cancelled, if yes, the system 
randomly picks a method for someone to win and lose. Your odds of winning 
are based upon your rank. You may win, lose, or tie, in which case both 
users are logged off. We think it's pretty cool :-) See for yourself :) 
Fighting is not allowed in the front_gate, I mean you can't even if ya
wanna :)

7. ^HGHow do I use color?^

Coloring inside the talker is by default turned off. The ".set color" command 
controls your options for color...the options are...
    .set color on      -  Turn your color on.
    .set color off     -  Turn your color off.
    .set color test    -  Test your terminal to see if it's color-capable

".h coloruse" shows you how to use coloring in text.
**Note with the color test it seems Yellow shows up as red on
some computers. This is normal.

8. ^HGWhy do I see weird code in front of some text, like \E[1;33;40m^

These are the ansi codes used to make color. They are not meant to be
seen. If you do see these, it means your computer/terminal is not color
compatible. You can get rid of these, by typing --> .set color off
If you use a modem program, you might be able to switch to ANSI/color
In your program, find terminal emulation and see if you can change it 
too "ANSI"  *Note: Remember when you leave PinWHeeLs you might have to 
change it back to its original settings for some net programs to function 
correctly.

9. ^HGHow do I set my stats?^

There are sevaral commands to input personal info. they are...
   .desc            - To enter the text that appears after your name
   .entpro          - To enter a profile
   .set email <your email address>
   .set gender <your gender>
   .set homepage <your WWW homepage, if you have one>
   .examine <user>  - To examine a user's profile   
   .ustat <user>    - To examine a user's full statistics (for PinWHeeLers 
                      and higher only)
    See .h <command> for more info.

10. ^HGI changed my password, and now the talker wont let me back
    in to my account! What do I do??^

You most likely used the wrong syntax for .password. It's
.password <new_password>  NOT .password <old_password> <new_password>
If this is not the case, let a level 3 or higher know.
