
You are at the login prompt.

If you have an account already set up on this talker, you
should enter your username and password at the respective
prompts.

If you don't, you should enter a username, a nickname, that 
you want to go by. This name cannot have any spaces or special 
characters in it. After you enter it, press return.
Then, when prompted, proceed to enter a password you 
would like to use for this account.
You are urged to pick a password that you will remember, but 
hard enough that others will not be able to guess.
Do not give your password to anyone, as you alone are responsible
for your account.
Next, read the agreement shown to you, and proceed to re-enter your
new password again for verification.
