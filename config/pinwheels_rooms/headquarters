You're what's apparently an underground room, with heavily armored walls, 
which are covered with red and black banners, with a strange symbol on it.  
There's a fireplace on one wall of the room, and on the other wall, there 
are several TV monitors.  There are speakers up in all the upper four 
corners, connected to a sound system on the floor.  Over near one corner of 
the room, there are pool tables, fussball tables, and several arcade games.  
In the middle of the room, there's a large, marble, oblong, cylindrical table,
with 7 oaken chairs, with red velvet padding near on end of the table, and 
several less decorated pine chairs, with black velvet padding around the rest
of the table.   The same symbol is engraved in the middle the table, with a 
hexagonal hole in the middle of that.  There are blue flames coming up from 
the middle of the hole in the table.
