Opening the door to the barn, you are greeted by the animals who call this
place home. This wooden structure doesn't seem very sturdy, but seems to
remind you of someplace you might have been before. Walking around, you
see some bales of hay set aside..perhaps this might be a nice place for a
barn dance? You see that there is a stall opened and you put your horse inside
and give him the fresh oats that Jasper, the barn-boy, has left out for new
visitors.
