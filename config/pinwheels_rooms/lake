Waves lap quietly at the shore as you look across a quiet azure lake. Set in
a valley, emcompassed by low green mountains in the distance, it is the 
tranquil sanctuary you have been seeking. Smooth pebbles line the beach which
meets a soft carpet of lush green grass. Ancient shade trees spread their
boughs overhead as you settle down on a blanket and drink in the peace.
