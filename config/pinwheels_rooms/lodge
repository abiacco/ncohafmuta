   Everywhere you look you see beautiful pictures of animals in the wild.  
The owners of PinWHeeLs do not believe in hunting for the purpose of 
trophies, so they display these wonderful photos instead. In a towering 
fifteen foot fireplace, a roaring fire burns, warming your body and your 
soul.  A large screen T.V. with VCR is standing in the corner for those 
rainy nights when outdoor activities are limited. Your heart warms with a 
feeling of peace and a love for nature.
