This is the humble home of the PinWHeeLs staff...in all directions you see 
entrances to the rooms of those most loved and the hardest workers here at 
PinWHeeLs.  You enter a sitting room, where members of the staff come to relax 
and shoot the breeze after a long days work.  Altho this room says "staff", 
anyone is welcome..so pull up a chair and enjoy the company.
