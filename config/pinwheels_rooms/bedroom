You enter an old style bedroom, with flower printed curtains and a wood 
burning stove in the corner for those chilly mountain nights.  Against 
the wall sits a huge feather bed with a fine down comforter, nice for 
snuggling in.  Fresh flowers sit on hand carved pine tables on each side 
of the bed.  Mmmm, smells nice...
