As you walk in the wilderness on a warm day, you notice an enormous hammock 
strung between two towering pine trees.  What a nice place to lie down 
and take a snooze!  Although the trees are tall, there is still a 
beautiful view of the sky between them.  May be a nice place to bring 
that special someone to cuddle and stargaze some clear evening...
