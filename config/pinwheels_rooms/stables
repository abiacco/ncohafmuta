This is where PinWHeeLs raises their prize winning Thoroughbreds that 
sometimes race in the Kentucky Derby (Not!).  Actually you see a lot of 
everyday trail horses, but they're friendly none the less.  Wrangler Fred 
will saddle one of them up for you if you want to take a ride.  Don't 
forget the apples and carrots...these horses love treats!
