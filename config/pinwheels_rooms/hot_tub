Take a chance, come on in and take a seat.  Hey, if it's too hot or cold 
for you, feel free to adjust the temperature.  And why not...This place 
is here for your pleasure and relaxation.  Just settle back and let the 
bubbles surround you, let the soothing heat open every pore in your 
body.  Feel the madness of your everyday world just slip away.  Listen 
closely and you might even hear your own heartbeat.  But remember to keep 
your eyes open, for you might see a deer somewhere out on the beautiful 
sprawling landscape around you.
