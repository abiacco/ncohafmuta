Over the stream stands an solid wood foot bridge, big enough for man or 
beast to cross.  The sun sparkles off the water as you dangle your feet 
in the cool crisp stream.  This is the ideal place to go to relax and get 
away from the noise.  The sound of the water trickling through the stones 
and pebbles helps your body to release it's tension and your mind to 
wander...
