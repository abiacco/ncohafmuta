You're on a winding red brick path through a jungle of life. Branches
from various species of trees hang over the path and brush your face
as you walk along.
 It's silent here except for the sound of trickling water from the small
creek that runs through the denseness, and the exotic birds chirping
overhead. Sun shines through the almost inivisble glass panes that house
this whole other world, warming you, and bringing life to the inhabitants.
