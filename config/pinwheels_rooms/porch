You stroll out onto a creaky wooden porch, the rotted railing barely able 
to hold the layers of dust upon it. At one time there may have been 
animals here, but they are long gone. The sky above is a troubled gray 
colour, indicated desolation and despair. Be warned that stepping from this
no longer allows us to protect you.
