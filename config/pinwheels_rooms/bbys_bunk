Actually this is a tent not a bunk, but Bbys_tentdidn't sound quite right so I
called it Bbys_bunk. :P Anyway WELCOME, pull up a sleepingbag and a couple of
pillows and have a seat. Drinks are in the cooler, and marshmallows in the bag
beside it. A HUGE fire burns just outside for heat and cooking. We are in
Algonquin Park beside one of their many beautiful lakes. Watch out for wild
animals that roam around here. If you look out the tent window you will see
Smoothie tied to a pole out of harms way. :P Lay down, look up and watch the
Shooting Stars and Northern Lights, they are bright here, NO pollution. In the
background you can hear the sounds of loons and the water as it laps the shore.
