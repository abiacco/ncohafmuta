You wonder into the most modern part of PinWHeeLs, the rec room.  Pool, 
ping pong, and foos ball are just a few the the games enjoyed here.  On 
the bookcase there's dozens of great books to read, and many board games 
for those nights when nature says it's time to stay inside.  A card table 
sits in the far corner.  Anyone up for a friendly game of cards? :)
