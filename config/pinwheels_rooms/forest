Century old trees tower above you.  In the distance you can see a vast 
chain of mountains and the familiar sounds of a stream can be heard.  
Along all the paths are wild berries, ripe for the picking.  The smell of 
wild flowers fills the air.  Towering above the trees you can see the 
ancient Citadel of Tristian.  You feel a peace that you have never 
felt before...knowing the protector of the forest will not allow any harm 
to befall you during your visit.

Thanks to Tristian for contributing this room desc.
