What a spectacular view!  You stand on top of a towering mountains, 
getting the bird's eye glimpse of the world below.  At the base of this 
mountain, you can see PinWHeeLs, hustling and bustling.  The air is crisp 
and you relax as you sit on the edge of a steep cliff.  Be careful!  It's 
a long way down! :)
