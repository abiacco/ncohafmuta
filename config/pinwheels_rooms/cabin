As you enter this century old wooden structure through it's squeaky 
front door, you are suddenly struck with awe at the sight of the many 
trophies scattered about the room.  As you look around this humble home, 
you see a plaque above the mantel which reads, "Chippendale's Place".  As 
you walk deeper you can almost feel the history contained within this 
mighty structure.  Go ahead...make yourself at home.  Take a seat on the 
bearskin rug, grab a cup of hot cocoa, and get comfy in front of the fire 
place...maybe even with that special someone.

Thanks to Chip for contributing the room description :)
