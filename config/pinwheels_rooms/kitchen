You will notice this kitchen has no stove..because the people of PinWHeeLs
hate to cook.  Note there *are* six microwaves though, and refrigerators
for all the beer and soda. Help yourself! The booze is locked away in the
liquor cabinet, so only those of legal age can have a key (sorry guys!).
Lists for dozens of pizza places line the fridge door, and you can see Hoss
sitting at the table munching on a piece of day old pizza and sending a
.tell now and then to friends..dreaming of the day when he will beat Ticklz
at a .fight (dream on buddy!)  Hey! if you have a minute..wanna clean our
fridge? I think there are new forms of life evolving in there :)
