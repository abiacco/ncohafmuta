There's a feeling of western in this living room, with fine wooden 
furniture and a huge oak bar in the corner.  Since this is the west, there 
isn't a TV or radio...out here people have to entertain themselves like 
in the old days, by reading or good old fashion chatting (but you can 
always go to the lodge to use the satelite dish if you must see that 
basketball game :P).
