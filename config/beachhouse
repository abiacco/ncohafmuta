You find yourself in a beautiful two level beachhouse.
The view outside the shiny bay window is spectacular, with ice blue
beaches and soft white sand warmed by the sun.  You begin to relax
as you drink in this wonderful setting.  Make yourself at home!
There's no one around for miles, and it's a beautiful day. Maybe
be a little risky and head out for a skinnydip ;)
