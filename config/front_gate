    PinWHeeLs is an acronym for "People Who Hate Lag".  The front gate is 
a meeting place for all that have one thing in common, how much they hate 
lag.  PinWHeeLs is a commune nestled in a warm mountain valley, far from the 
hustle and bustle of everyday internet life.  This commune has horses for 
riding, mountains for climbing and all the necessities for a wonderful 
life without lag.  Although, every now and then, that creepy little lag 
monster will try to ruin PinWHeeLs.  It's up to all the citizens of 
PinWHeeLs to stand together to fight that nasty little creature.  Hopefully 
together, we can make PinWHeeLs what most everyone wants in real life, a 
life without lag. :)
