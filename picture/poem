Figurative Timeline
-------------------

Try and care
Giving your life
Selling your soul
Winging it

You never knew
Words from your mouth
Shattered this hope
Lingering here

So far from close
No paper could show
Wanting this emotion
No permission

Hurt beyond belief
small to many's hearts
HUGE TO HIS
Hanging on

Friends to you
Not good enough
Too attentioned from you
Wishing more

Thoughts en rage
Whirlpooled inside
Funneling pointed
Nothing left

Salted gravity
From the flesh
Once one with you
Now on its own
Alone like him
