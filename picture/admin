
.admin command to administrate almost all aspects and settings of the
talker. The command will be command line based with descendingly specific
levels. Sort of like the interface for Cisco IOS with their routers. All
changes made using the command will be memory-effective ONLY unless saved
to the config. A huge feature of this will be allowing administrator to
edit,load, and save multiple configs on the fly. With one command you can
change your talker to a whole other theme with new rooms,
strings, and command names.
