Actually, if you had a film copy of "Wizard of Speed and Time" and
a magnifier, you'd notice in the Bar Scene (starring my e.b.p. in
a natural role) that his drink's swizzel stick has a little skull
on its tip.  To wit:                     _ 
                                 .      (")
                                    .    W
                                      .  |
                                   \___._|_/
                                    \  . @/
                                     \ : /
                                      \:/
                                       H
                                       H
                                       H
                                       H

Watch out, Chuckles!  That's how it starts!!  And then you start
copying other ascii's you find on the Net, and "improving" them,
and then roaming through every NewsGroup looking for _more_ ascii
pix to collect and fix, and MORE!  And posting them at all hours
of the night!!!!  And, and....wait, here, i'll show you:

                                       (We'll be right back!!!1)
