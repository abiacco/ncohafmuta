Let me make this perfectly clear:  _I_am_not_Gumby_.

I don't care if we're both green, lanky, stop-motion bibliophiles
who both know the same animator (Jim Danforth), and have the same
background muzak in our respective films.  I don't care if you've
never seen us both in the same place at the same time.  Because
no matter what you may have been led to believe, we are entirely
separate entities, with separate careers, hopes, dreams, and
personal angst.

Moreover, I have bushier eyebrows, a symmetrical skull, and am a
good 5'7" taller than my colleague.  There is also an important
distinguishing feature which is obvious when you compare the two
of us full-length -- but I'd rather not be specific because it's
always been an uncomfortable topic for Gum, and anyone who's made
such a sacrifice just to maintain a high singing voice all these
years deserves our understanding.

Lastly, even though I feel that I've covered this subject enough,
I want to quash all spurious rumors being generated by Persons
UnKmentIBOned, concerning the "gumby" in my email signature.  It
just happens to be the code-name of the J.Kajiya Supercomputer at
Caltech University, which permits my access to the InterNet, and
all of your accounts.

"gumby" is doubtless an acronym for intensely top secret activity,
its true meaning open to speculation.  Current guesses range from
"Gigaplex Unitizeable Monolith from Be-Yond" (Derek Woolverton)
to "Godzilla's Under My Bed - Yow!" (Meriday Beth).

And it is surely just one more twist of the InterFates that its
companion computer at Caltech is code-named "pokey".
