@SONG: The Dam at Otter Creek

When all that's left to do
Is reflect on what's been done
This is where sadness breathes
The sadness of everyone

Just like when the guys built the
Dam at Otter Creek and all the
Water oiled up
Deep enough to dive

We took the dead man in sheets
To the river flanked by love
Deep enough to dive
Deep enough to dive
Be here now

We took him there and three
In a stretcher made from trees
That had passed in the storm
Leave the hearse behind
To leave the curse behind
Be here now
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Selling the Drama

And to love a god
And to fear a flame
And to burn a crowd that has a name

ANd to right or wrong
And to meek or strong
It is known, just scream it from the wall

CHORUS
I've willed, I've walked, I've read
I've talked, I know, I know
I've been here before
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that

It's the sun that burns
It's the wheel that turns
It's the way we sing that matters eardream
And to Christ a cross
And to me a chair
I will sit and earn the ransom from up here

CHORUS

And to love a god
And to fear a flame
And to burn a crowd that has a name

CHORUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: I Alone

It's easier not to be wise
And measure those things by your brains
I sank into Eden with you
Alone in the church by and by

I'll read to you here, save your eyes
You'll need them, your boat is at sea
Your anchor is up, you've been swept away
And the greatest of teachers won't hesitate
To leave you there, by yourself
Chained to fate

CHORUS
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
Fear is not the end
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
Fear is not the end of this!

It's easier not to be great
And measure those things by your eyes
We long to be here by his resolve
Alone in the church by and by
To cradle the baby in space
And leave you there by yourself chained to fate

CHORUS

Oh, now we took it back too far
Only love can save us now, all these riddles that you burn
All come runnin' back to you, all these rhythms that you hide
Only love can save us now, all those riddles that you burn
Yeah, yeah, yeah

CHORUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Iris

I liked the way my hand looked
On your head
In the presence of my knuckles
But the beauty of this vision alone
Just like yesterday's sunset
Has been perverted by the sentimental
And mistaken for love

CHORUS
The felix of your truth will always break it
And the iris of your eye will always shake it
And the armies, the armies I have created
Will always hate it
Will always bait you on

I liked the way my hand looked on your head
In the presence of my struggle
But the beauty of this vision alone
I can't shake from my tree just yet
It keeps invading all my private moments
Listen to me now

CHORUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Lightning Crashes

Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
Her placenta falls to the floor
The angel opens here eyes
The confusion sets it
Before the doctor can even close the door

Lightning crashes, an old mother dies
Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes
The confusion that was lies
Belongs now to the baby down the hall

CHORUS
Oh, now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes
Pale blue clored iris, presents the circle
And puts the glory out to hide, hide

CHORUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Top

This is not helping me at all
What you are doing here
In the name of God and love
It's the distribution of fear
Pyarmids, healing wires, analysts with fame
I haven't got your degree
And I forget your name

CHORUS
Pick me up and put me on the ground
Set me up and spin me all around
No, you are not the one I wish to see

This is not he lying me at all
Where did we get this plan?
That you could give to me
What I might already have
Pyramids, healing wires, a musician's fame
I've lunteered you my eyes
In place of facing me

CHORUS

Oh, Hitler, in a robe of truth
My emptiness has built your altar
And I've worshipped myself in you forever
Until now!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: All Over You

Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused
For being strange

Our love is no other
Than me alone
For me all day

Our love is like water angels
Pinned down and abused

All over you, all over me
The sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now, lay me down
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Shit Towne

The Weavers live up the street from me
THe crackheads, they live down the street from me
The tall grass makes it hard to see
Beyond my property
Hey man, this is criminal
This hard line symmetry of people and pets
We don't bother anyone
We keep to ourselves

The mailman visits each of us in turn
We don't bother anyone
We keep to ourselves
The mailman visits each of us in time

Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In Shit Towne
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live in our town
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: T.B.D.

In the moment I was losing my head
Readin' too much and losin' my head
And I was
Rachin' forward, I was already there
Readin' too much and losin' my head

This information caused a cut in the line
Now I'm remembering God and readin'
Too much it's so nice
The point is smaller than the ants in the grass
I'll have to put it away now
In the morning there are things to bread
Words to be said and food to be fed but I won't be there
I'll be clutchin' on a 
Megaphone pointed at my head
WOuld you be there
Would you kindly read this word for word so loud and clear
I can't remember it all
it needs to be clear, I tell you
If the feeling drops out of your voice
Would you kindly pick it up

This is how I'll go out tonight
Dressed in blue, by the book tonight
This is how I'll go out tonight
But I don't need a book

We're talin' anchors, talkin' ships
We're talkin' seas, we're talkin' everything you need
You should be workin' now, not only askin' how
And the whereabouts of where you'll be
I don't suspect you will be thinking
When the brain is dead and the mind has taken over
This is a kill
This is not a game
WHere have you been
Are you with us?
Can you hear us?
Got the megaphone pointed at you
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Stage

I wanna feel
I wanna try
I wanna rock in the city tonight
I wanna deal
Don't wanna die
I wanna bring my Captain Hook into the light

People I've seen my day
Ranting and raving this beauty away
We are by and large the same
But words are too feeble, they cannot contain
He was a "rock and roll messiah"
She was known for her child care
The truth is gonna give up the world
If you can give up the stage
If I can give up the stage
If we can give up the stage

Come to this, I can't come to you
Don't do this, wake me up tonight
Come to this, I won't come to you
Don't do this, wake me up tonight
(P.S. Do not drive and swear!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Waitress

Come on baby leave some change behind
She was a bitch, but I don't care
She brought our food out on time
And wore a funky berrette in her hair

Come on baby leave some change behind
She was a bitch but good enough
To leave soe change, everybody's good enough for some change

The girl's got family
She needs cash to buy aspirin for her pain
Everybody's good enough for some change

We all get the flu, we all get AIDS
We've got to stick together
After all, everybody's good enough for some change
Some fucking change!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: Pillard of Davidson

Warm bodies I sense
Are not machines that can only make money
Past, perfect tense
Words for a feeling and all I've discovered

I'll be along soon
With medicine supposed to, designed to
Make you high
I'll be along soon
With words for a feeling and all I've discovered
Old, bad eyes
Old, bad eyes
Old, bad eyes

On loneliness coes
Go see the foreman, go see the profiteer
On loneliness drives
We're takin' our time movin' shit for
This holy slime
Old, bad eyes
Old, bad eyes
Old, badeyes, almighty fear

The shepherd won't leave me alone
He's in my face and I
The shephered of my days
And I want you here by my heart
And my head, I can't start till I'm dead
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SONG: White, Discussion

I talk of freedom
You talk of the flag
I talk of revolution
You'd much rather brag
And as the decibels of this disenchanting
Discourse continue to dampen the day
The coin flips again, again and again
And agains as our sanity walks away

All the discussion
Through politcally correct
Is dead beyond destruction
Though it leaves me quite erect
And as the final sunset rolls behind the earth
And the clock is finally dead
I'll look at you, you'll look at me
And we'll cry about
But this will be what we said
This will be what we said

Look where all this talking got us, baby
