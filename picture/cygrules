2. Only speak Ncohafmuta in the presence of a lady.

3. Any reference of myself to the name "Cyggie" is reserved for authorized
   human-like persons. The following are these: Scupper, Princess, Joelie,
   Ashley, Amanda, Ann, Gidget, Supergirl, Bambi, Amy, Alia, (what's with

    fashion, or as if in a perplexed state.  (by Melkir, 1/17/95)

7. The word "piece" is spelled "peice"..yes, PEICE.

   don't think it. You will certainly die.

9. A "bonk" is a way to express (occasionally amused) displeasure.
   In order to maintain homeostasis in the universe, a "bonk"
   REQUIRES an "oif" in response.  It's a Rule.
