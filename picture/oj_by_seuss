The O.J. Trial, as told by The Cat in the Hat

I did not kill my lovely wife.
I did not slash her with a knife.
I did not bonk her in the head.
I did not know that she was dead.

I stayed at home that fateful night.
I took a cab, then took a flight.
The bag I had was just for me.
My bag! My bag! Leave it be!

When I came home I had a gash.
My hand was gashed from broken glass.
I cut my hand upon a glass.
A broken glass did cause that gash.

My friend, he took me for a ride.
All through L.A., from side to side.
From North to South, we took a ride.
But from the cops, I could not hide.

And now we've been here for a year.
A year! A year! Just sitting here!
The DNA, the hem and haw.
The circus-hype the viewers saw.
A year! A year! Just sitting here!
And lawyers charge by the hour, I fear.

If I'm found "Guilty," I'll appeal.
Appeal!  Appeal!  I will appeal!
I'll wheedle and whine; I'll cut a deal!
If it's "Not Guilty," so glad I'll feel.


And this little Diddy suggested by OJ's statement to Judge Ito
that he could not, would not, kill Nicole and Ron.  Ito's lines
are in capital letters.

DID YOU DO THIS AWFUL CRIME?
     DID YOU DO IT ANYTIME?

     I did not do this awful crime.
     I could not, would not, anytime.

     DID YOU TAKE THIS PERSON'S LIFE?
     DID YOU DO IT WITH A KNIFE?

     I did not do it with a knife.
     I did not, could not, kill my wife.
     I did not do this awful crime
     I could not, would not, anytime.

     DID YOU LEAVE A POOL OF BLOOD?
     DID YOU DROP THIS BLOODY GLOVE?

     I did not leave a pool of blood.
     I can not even wear that glove.
     I did not do it with a knife.
     I did not, could not, kill my wife.
     I did not do this awful crime
     I could not, would not, anytime.

    I did not do it, so I say
    It's not my blood or DNA
