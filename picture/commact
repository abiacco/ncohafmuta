Something I did to help fight CDA.  Send copies to everyone you know ASAP



The Communications Decency Act is unconstitutional, we all know that, 
but many people in our dear government don't seem to.  So to guide them along,
I propose that all the people of the United States of America send an E-mail 
protest to president@whitehouse.gov, at the same time.  What better day then 
President's Day?  So on February 19, 1996, at 7:25 pm EST, please send a copy 
of the following to president@whitehouse.gov, and any other government 
organizations that you can think of.  Also, please circulate this message 
around.  Tell all your friends, post it around newsgroups, pass it on to 
your neighbors.  If we don't do anything, what will be next?  

This involves all of us.

	We the people, of the United States of America, find the 
Communications Decency Act, to be unconstitutional and indecent in all ways.  

	The Bill of Rights, clearly prohibits government-established religion,
such as forcing one's morals, ethics and ideals on another, let alone a entire
nation.  In addition, freedom of worship, speech, and the press is guaranteed 
to us by the same bill.  The use of the internet can be included in all 
three categories.

	We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, 
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

	We the people, have fought this same war in the past.  

	There is no need to repeat it.
