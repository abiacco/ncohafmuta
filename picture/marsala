by Cygnus (thelittleprince@asteroid-b612.org)

1 cup flour (seasoned with salt & pepper)
4 tbsp olive oil
4 tbsp butter
1/2 tsp oregano
8 oz mushrooms (sliced)
5/8 cup marsala wine
2 tsp chopped garlic
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts

Heat the oil and 2 tbsp of the butter in a skillet until bubbling lightly.
Dredge the chicken in the flour and shake off the excess. Cook the chicken
on medium heat for about 2 minutes. Turn the breasts over, add the mushroom
pieces around them, the remaining butter, and add the garlic. Cook for 2
more minutes, until lightly browned on 2nd side. Add the wine and oregano.
Stir once. Cover the pan and simmer for 10 minutes. Voila!
