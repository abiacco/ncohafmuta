Documentation?  Are you CRAZY?  Oh... All right... 

This is a hodgepodge of stuff taken from a stagnant but 
running, non-development agent, known as Thoth on DragonMud
(telnet dragonmud.org 4201) and currently ported/developed for the
talker "PinWHeeLs" by me, Cygnus (ncohafmuta@asteroid-b612.org) to work on the
SunOS and Linux operating system. I make no guarantees that this bot will
work on other OSs. You're lucky if it does. :-)

It's up to you to read through storybot.c, make the customizations
that it requires and add any supporting directories, if it's unable
to create them upon startup. I started structuring him for user
interaction besides the story stuff.. the function handle_action()
is where I began.

What you will find:
manual  ---  how to use the storybot (flatfile).
restart  --- The startup script.
compile  --- The simple script I use to compile the bot
Stories   --- The directory that holds all learned stories.
storybot.c --- the current source code. (has a lame paginator
        to break up long lists of stories, and some decorative
        characterization for most recent implementation)

DO:
    
    In storybot.c:
    Replace the BOT_NAME with the name you want to give your bot.
    Change the destination address (host) and port (port) in the code.
    Change the bot's password in #define CONNMSG, to what his password
    will be when you create his username on the talker.
    Change anything else you deem necessary to work with your talker.

1)
    If this is for a talker..create an account on the talker for the
    bot with the name and password you put in the code file.
    Make the bot the highest rank in the talker.
    For ncohafmuta people, this can be done with:
    .pcreate <bot_name> <highest_level_in_talker> <bot_password>
    (example: .pcreate daisy 4 botpass)

2)
    * Make sure the bot's account has highlighting for .tells/pages TURNED
      OFF!
     For ncohafmuta people, you can do this 2 ways.
      1) log in as the bot and type ".set hi" until it toggles to off.
      2) as the BOTS_ROOTID type ".force <bot_name> hi" until it toggles off

3)
    * If you want the bot to recognize and output colored names (preferred)
      Make sure the bot's color is on (.set color)
     For ncohafmuta people, you can do this 2 ways.
      1) log in as the bot and type ".set color" until it toggles to on.
      2) as the BOTS_ROOTID type ".force <bot_name> color on"

4)
    * Turn the .monitor on for the bot to..
	  *** Monitoring is now on for users ***

     For ncohafmuta people, you can do this 2 ways.
      1) log in as the bot and type: ".monitor" until it says that
      2) as the BOTS_ROOTID (with the bot logged in) type ".force
         <bot_name> com .monitor" until it says that

5)
    Type "compile" to compile the bot

6)
    Type "restart" to boot the bot.

TIPS:
as the BOTS_ROOTID you have control over the bot like noone else.
You can force it, tell it to delete any story you wish, abort writing by
anyone, etc..
You can also tell it to reboot or shutdown itself.
.tell it "reboot" to make it reboot itself
.tell it "shutdown" to make it shutdown itself

The bot formally was designed to work with the standard communications format
set in the constants.h file in the ncohafmuta code. Now he works on a common
format, generated internally by the ncohafmuta talker code. This means
you can change the communications format any way you want in constants.h
and the bot will still work. This is current as of version 1.3 of the bot 
and 1.2.2b-2 of ncohafmuta.

You may want to fire off mail to John Crane (jopsy@dragonmud.org)
letting him know that you obtained this code from " Cray ", and are using
it, and for what, just so he knows.

DO NOT "expect" either John Crane OR myself to support this code,
OR answer questions from overweening users having trouble getting
it running...although I usually will :-)

However, If you patch it, fix it, or modify it, patches are very
welcome at jopsy@dragonmud.org and ncohafmuta@asteroid-b612.org.

This code is not for resale or value added arrangements.  
Distribution is strictly on an "as-interested" basis, in
other words, please don't post the code or put it up on 
an ftp archive for the world to grab.

Thank you, and enjoy!
