Sometimes there will be several different paragraphs
by different authors following the one I just read.
If you wish to continue along a particular author's
branch, just say "next" followed by the name of the
author. For instance, if a paragraph has following paragraphs
by Yossarian and Lynx, saying "next lynx" will make me
go on to Lynx's paragraph and branch of the story.
(CS types will recognize this as a tree structure.)
If you simply say "next", I will try to stay with the
same author as the current paragraph's; if the author
didn't write a following paragraph, I will just pick the
first paragraph that was written to follow the current one.
