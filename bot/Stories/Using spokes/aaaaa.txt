Once you've told me, in one way or another, that you want
to write something, my full attention is focused on you.
Anything you say will be interpreted as part of the story,
except for certain commands such as "delete", "reread",
and "abort", which you may find useful when writing. (Saying
help" while writing explains these various commands.)
When you're writing, an empty say or whisper (something which
produces the message '<your name> says ""') ends the paragraph. At
that point, if the paragraph contains any text, I save it,
and then let you dictate another paragraph.
