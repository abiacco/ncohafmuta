Saying 'format' while I'm reading a story toggles my
paragraph formatting feature. When paragraph formatting is off,
I read lines just as they were originally told to me.
When formatting is on, I rearrange the line breaks so that lines
are as long as possible, but less than 80 characters.
If you're reading a story with extra-long lines or paragraphs,
you may want to turn formatting on to read it more easily.
When reading poetry, or other stories where the line breaks
are significant, you'll probably want formatting off.
Paragraph formatting is always turned off when I'm in write
mode.
