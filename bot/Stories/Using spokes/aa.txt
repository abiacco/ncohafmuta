As you may notice, I work in units of paragraphs.
When I'm reading a story, I pause at the end of
each one so that you can tell me what I should
do next. Saying "next", for instance, makes me go
to the next paragraph; saying "back" makes me go
back a paragraph. You can also do things like
add a following paragraph (more on this later),
or edit the paragraph I just read, if you wrote
it originally. Saying 'help' while I'm in the
middle of the story describes these commands and more.
