Things to do..in no good order!
--------------------------------
(if you would like to assist on any of these and are good in C,
 let me know..ncohafmuta@asteroid-b612.org)

1.5.x
-----
* = DONE
1 . Maybe distinguish smtp codes between errors/successes/failures as per 
    charts
2 . Maybe show MAIL FROM and RCPT TO output in logs
3 . Storybot devel.
4 . Remove deprecated functions (e.g. .desc)
5 . Finish terminal type detection/ and write code for talker to actually 
    use it functionally.
*6. .set localecho (maybe magic keyword for use at login prompt too)
	*add set_localecho() prototype
	*change set_car_ret() and set_white_space() prototype (no inpstr)
	*add set_localecho helpfile
	*fix set_space helpfile
	*add localecho login keyword
	*add localecho info to loginhelp file.
	*add cr or lf respectively to clients that only send one or the 
	 other
	*make sure localecho doesn't write if passhid is on (login, 
	 afk-lock)
	*add write_char() function and prototype
7 . Fix balance of tell colors (to and from should be colored or not 
    colored or have an option to change behavior)
8 . change ".set icq" to ".set im" then either add ".set imtype" or make 
    it .set im <type> <handle>
    e.g. .set im yahoo poetry_guy_23. Update .examine and ".set show" 
    format info.
9 . auto-afk option
10. new config stuff from below.
11. stacked colors
12. Add user afk status to soft-reboot DB
13. Maybe add room conversation buffers to soft-reboot DB
14. Either redesign atmospheric algorithm, or update code to say that the atmos's
    number is not a probability/chance number!!

Future
------
Add IPV6 support 
Add SSL/TLS connection encryption support 

Maybe put .to messages in tell buffer for users that go idle. Alternative 
is to auto-afk a user after XX number of minutes idle, then a .to would 
fail since the user is idle.

Put filesize or line limit on system logs so they cant fill up disk. Either
stop logging at limit or start wrapping (might be resource wasteful). Put
limits on amount of RSS or SIZE memory we can use, so malicious users
cant malloc() to death the talker.

Ability to turn off some or all logging from in the talker.

More flexible autopromotion conditions.

Wildcard * site banning. Change format of restrict files.

Fix/enhance write out code in write_str() write_str_nr() because it 
doesn't take in account color codes when writing out column-specific text 
blocks to user

Add new options that were added to cmail/wipe to rmail/read too:

Multi-user recepients for .move

Add direct TLS/SSL/SSH support

.admin command to administrate almost all aspects and settings of the
talker. The command will be command line based with descendingly specific
levels. Sort of like the interface for Cisco IOS with their routers. All
changes made using the command will be memory-effective ONLY unless saved
to the config. A huge feature of this will be allowing administrator to
edit,load, and save multiple configs on the fly. With one command you can
change your talker to a whole other theme with new rooms,
strings, and command names.
 Tentative commands:
   MAIN
	commit	              - Save current settings to memory and
				current boot
	commit startup-config - Save current settings to the default
				boot config
	commit <config name>  - Save config settings to a new or
				existing alternate config
	copy <config> <config> - Copy a whole existing config to a new or
				existing config name
	config <type>	      - Enter configuration commannd line for
				<type> which can be rooms,strings,globals,
				or commands
	load		      - Reload the current SAVED disk config
	load <config name>    -	Load specific config into talker.
	show configs	      - List all configurations
	show <type>	      - Show settings for <type> under current
				config
	delete <config name>  - Deletes a specific configuration
   GENERAL LINE COMMANDS
	?		      - List commands for this line menu
	exit		      - Exit up from this line menu
   ROOM CONFIG LINE MENU COMMANDS
	show		      - Show all settings for this config
	add <room name>
		exit <room name>
		hide
		atmos
		publock
		privlock
	delete <room name>
	modify <room name>
   STRING CONFIG LINE MENU COMMANDS
   GLOBAL CONFIG LINE MENU COMMANDS
   COMMAND CONFIG LINE MENU COMMANDS

Allocate memory for structures dynamically. Right now user structures are 
allocated on bootup for MAX_USERS. Should allocate as needed (login/logout)
Same for rooms. All rooms are allocated on bootup. Should be as
needed..i.e. create and destroy rooms based on if users are in them, or
are immediately ready to enter them.
(start with mallocing for area conv buffer, user conv buffers, and user macros, 
because these take the most memory)

Split code into multiple C files (in progress!)

Enhance color codes so users can STACK codes. like:
^HR^BLthis is bold red and blinking^

Make ".ignore alerts" maybe also send an alert when a user logs off.

Possibly either make certain who columns not length-flexible, or make 
the formatting accomadate the flexible-lengths (from constants.h)

Create standards for different terminal types

Implement and create load-in module support. Maybe have a directory with 
a .c file for every user .<command>
This also includes re-loading of commands and other data from 
inside the talker.

Port code to Windows natively
(might not need because it already works great with Cygwin)

CYGWIN STUFF:
1. popen() doesn't work right

Greatly enhance web port so that it can truely send and receive HTTP
requests. (85% functional) _menu functions need to be finished for
users to use advanced functions in webpage (send mail, read mail,
read help, read message boards)
Help reading may or may not be on _menu ( i suppose a person really doesn't
need to be a user to read help) Formatting will probably be same as when
you search for users.
Reading mail formatting might be top frame for the header, middle frame for
message list, with columns of
1) Timestamp
2) sender's name a link to their profile (popup in new
window)
3/4) maybe real small column links to their email addy and homepage.
5) a column for the first few words of the email to distiguish it
6) a view button/link to view message in the larger frame below
Maybe make an _admin function for viewing talker status. See if up/down,
set up/down, set system options, room editor, etc..

Start inter-talker connectivity

Maybe create and implement an email gateway to external email. Maybe have
a talker email account and to send email to a person you put their name
in the Subject: field. Or maybe just <name>.<talker_name>@<talker's host>

Things being considered still
-----------------------------
* Using a database
* Using Async I/O threads
* Encrypting all user files
* Mail folders w/folder management
* .set age (maybe? possibly too customized for the distribution code)
* Add route command to display a route between two rooms.  Maybe 
  make it an option of another command instead of making a new command? Or
  maybe the user should not be lazy and use .map? :)
* Centralizing room flags to a command..and adding addition flags.
  .set <room> visible (room is visible in exits and .rooms and .who)
  .set <room> invisible (room is hidden in exits and .rooms and .who)
  .set <room> public (unlocks room for enterage)
  .set <room> private (locks room from enterage)
  .set <room> windy (talk in the room also shows up in adjacent rooms)
  .set <room> abode (users can .set home to this room)
  .set <room> tellable (you can send tells from (to?) the room)
  .set <room> talkable (you can say, mutter, emote, to in the room)
  .set <room> readable (you can read the message board in the room)

<room> can be replace by "here" if it's meant for the current room.
as in: .set here public
