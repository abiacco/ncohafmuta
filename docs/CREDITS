Credits for this code distribution go to..
------------------------------------------

Deep, for writing the original Iforms code.

Neil Robertson, for writing NUTS, which Iforms was originally based on.

Arctic, for writing the auth_user code which is public domain.

Jazzin, for tons of input, code ideas, finding bugs, adding socials,
adding code, a few tutorial files, bullshit work, and being a pain in the 
ass. ;-) but NOT for filling up the server disk with a dumb-ass CGI script!

Joelie, for being the BIGGEST pain in the ass about bugs, glitches, adding
new features, not releasing tons of patch levels, and for blaming me for
everything that's not my fault.

Calysto, for doing bullshit (i.e. tedious) work regarding ANSI compliance
and being an anti-people dork. ;-) He's the "Here's 1000 warnings, here's
how to fix them..do it!" man.

Dave Jarvis (Thangalin), for letting me include his Java Terminal Emulator
in the code distribution.

Rager, for joining me in the ritual sacrifice of sleep to help me test
multi-commands and other things, for going through an endless number of
reboots, for the races to log back into the talker after a reboot, and for
being her natural wonderful freaky self.

Andy, (of Amnuts fame) for insights we have given each other back and forth, 
and for his talker.com account to do glibc2 testing.

NoWhereMan, of NWL and Neon Lights for letting me use these talkers as a
testing ground for a soft-reboot bug.

OliverJones, (author of the TinyMUCK code) and Cynbe ru Taren (Chee Lan
- muq author) for their help on an accept()/fork() problem.

Nate, for compiling on his OS/2 box with EMX

Lights, for compiling on his Mac OS X box.

Ziffnab, for usage of his OpenBSD account to fix compile-time warnings.
	
Fellow coders, admins, and talker users for their input/ideas.
