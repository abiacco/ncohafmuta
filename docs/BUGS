Everyone knows (or should know) that no REAL program has no bugs. As we
always try to make a program technically perfect, usually it just doesn't
happen, therefore..

 Known bugs in this code
 -----------------------

 None currently known!


PLEASE, if you find a bug, glitch, or anything like that, email me and
let me know. Contrary to popular belief, i probably HAVEN'T found the bug
and people probably HAVEN'T emailed me about it (because they think that
someone else has emailed me) which leads to noone telling me :-)
