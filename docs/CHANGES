                      /*** Ncohafmuta 1.5.* changes ***/
Quick need-to-do?:
* if user .hilite==2 multi-tells with a lot of colored names in it might
cut off the recipients (because of the input socket limit imposed)
* need to fix web port so you don't need to put a / after the port number
in the URL to get it to work??

 09/17/05
* Changed cast of last argument of execlp() call in resolver_client.c.
  Newer GCCs throw a sentinel warning if not cast correctly.

 09/01/04
* Moved more DNS resolution functionality into resolve_add function, 
  some which was in the log_misc_connect function
* Slightly modified connection-based log entry content.
* Slightly modified SMTP-based log entry content.

 04/11/04 1.5.3
* Added a temp. user struct called bytes_read.
* Added a function and prototype called check_flood_limits()
* Added flood protection for input and output.
* Added FLOOD_INPUT_LIMIT and FLOOD_OUTPUT_LIMIT protection settings to 
  hdrfiles/constants.h
* Added a README.flood_protection file in docs/
* Added a check for no define fortune program
* Fixed a missing dependency in Makefile.in which would cause main.c not
  to compile itself again if changed.
* Fixed glitch in write_log buffering.

 03/20/04 1.5.2
* Version 1.4.2 changes
* Updated ascii code comments in socket_funcs.c
* Changed miscnum2 user structure to localecho. Added "localecho" keyword 
  to login prompt to turn on echoing. Added ".set localecho" command. 
  Added info to ".set show". This will work with charmode AND linemode 
  clients. Updated info in loginhelp file to talk about localecho.
* Added write_char() func for localecho support.
* Changed set_car_ret() and set_white_space() funcs to not take inpstr.
* Updated helpfiles. Added set_localecho helpfile.
* Added CR or LF respectively to clients that only send one or the other.

 03/20/04 1.4.2
* Fixed glitch in t_who with buffering.
* Try to dynamically make proper width for room column in .who headers 
  now.

 03/15/04 1.5.1
* Version 1.4.1 changes
* Some storybot action/command development

 03/15/04 1.4.1
* Fixed glitch with resetting autoforward limits at midnight, where if 
  a user was online when the reset was done, their limit wouldn't get reset 
  back to 0
* Updated SMTP delivery from and to envelopes to use <> enclosers as per RFC
* Added header file depends to Makefile.in, so make knows to recompile objects 
  when a .h file changes (don't need to do a "make objclean" now, if you just
  change a .h file). Also cleaned up file a bit.
* Updated docs/smtp_handling.txt explaining SMTP error/failure/success
  codes and command-reply sequences

 11/05/03 1.5.0 (new development version)
* Version 1.4.0 copied to start version 1.5.0. No code release.

 11/05/03 1.4.0
* Updated README.windows with info for getting a small, free mail server 
  for sending/forwarding mail out from the talker.

 07/01/03 1.3.9
* Fixed race doing queue_flush_www(), where free_sock() could be called 
  twice on a socket, causing a segfault.
* Added bad socket check in free_sock()
* Updated some of the rwho listings to current IPs
* Removed hard-coded system name from EXT_WHO3 in hdrfiles/constants.h
* Added some comments in hdrfiles/constants.h

 06/08/03
* Updated Cygwin documentation in docs/README.windows a bit
* Fixed very strict 'may be undefined' warnings for comm_cmds.c, server.c, 
  write_funcs.c, check_funcs.c (so far only seen under Cygwin)

 01/29/03 1.3.8
* Added do_stafflist() call to startup/reboots.
* Moved do_stafflist() for ROOT_ID creation out of init_user(), and to 
  do_login(), as while in init_user(), the ROOT_ID's userfile is not 
  written to disk yet, and do_stafflist() reads user levels from disk.
* Added do_stafflist() call to .reinit
* Removed prototype declaration for getdomainname/gethostname under 
  Cygwin.

 12/26/02
* Fixed bug in send_mail where sending to all users (-a) put the -a 
  in the mailed message.

 11/22/02
* Added WEB_FORBIDDEN and WEB_SERVER_ERROR variables to constants.h.
  Added more file read/write failure checking in whowww_funcs.c. 
  Added log entry for web_opt[]s when a .reinit is done.

 08/03/02 1.3.7
* Added DO_TRACKING option to constants.h to easily set whether
  the talker should do tracking or not.

 06/29/2002 1.3.6
* Added login limiting. This is, ip x.x.x.x will be auto-restricted 
  when connecting more than y tiems in 1 minute. Default is 10.
  You can enable/disable this with LOGIN_LIMITING in constants.h
* Moved ip address getting, to before motd. This is to facilitate ip
  restriction and login limiting checking
* Added additional hostname restriction checking after we get a 
  reply from the resolver clipon, because in the login we might not
  know the resolved hostname right away.
* Modified check_restriction() to take an argument to check just IP 
  or just hostname.
* Changed resolver_clipon DNS resolution a bit. Message sent from 
  talker to clipon now doesn't contain the SYS_LOOK_FAILED message, 
  just a *, this is for easier parsing by the clipon and by the
  talker on getting a reply from the clipon (since this field wont ever
  contain spaces. The clipon now tacks a space onto the reply to the
  talker. The talker's read_resolver_reply function now will read the 
  reply buffer until it's empty. This is in case the clipon sends a 
  reply with more than 1 ip/host in it, which is possible under a lot
  of resolutions being done. Previously, more than one ip/host combo
  in a reply would corrupt a user's host info.
* Made configure say what files were created, and also had it create
  a config.status file with the last successful configure command run.
* Created new source file, set_funcs.c which contains the functions
  from server.c dealing with the .set command
* Began moving informational setting commands to .set. Moved .desc
  to .set desc, .entermsg to .set entermsg, .exitmsg to .set exitmsg,
  .succ to .set succ, .fail to .set fail, .entpro to .set profile
  Created old_func() which will redirect the old syntaxes to the new
  functions, while telling the user that said old syntax will be de-
  precated soon and to use the new syntax.
* Renamed succm() to set_succ(), failm() to set_fail(), exitm() to 
  set_exitmsg(), enterm() to set_entermsg(), enter_pro() to 
  set_profile().  Changed and copied helpfiles for said functions.

 06/02/2002 1.3.5
* Fixed small glitch in send_mail where (on some systems) talker would 
  segfault when you tried to email a non-existant user. Cause was a 
  badly formatted log line. Only native to 1.3.4

 05/21/2002 1.3.4
* Added multi-mails and friend mails to .smail (user,user,user and -f)
* Updated smail helpfile.
* Cleaned up send_mail() a little more.
* Fixed typos and grammar errors in the tutorials.
* Put prelim. probed terminal type under ".set show" for now.

 05/04/2002 1.3.3
* Fixed glitch in exec_com where if users were online and the permission to 
  write to the lastcommand file was denied when a user did a command, the 
  talker segfaulted.
* Added send_ext_mail() function to consolidate code and send external email
  out. (to smtp_funcs.c). Modified auto_expire(), fmail(), send_mail(), and
  mail_verify() to use this.
  Added level-based/mass-mail ability to send_mail(). See .smail helpfile 
  on use.
  Multi-user mail to follow at some point. Cleaned up send_mail() a bit.
* Stopped writing bad file I/O error to user if couldn't write to the last
  logins file, when they logged in.
* Took epass argument out of mail_verify() and write_verifile(). In my_login()
  copied password to ustr[user].login_pass
* Copied ustr[user].login_name to ustr[user].say_name in my_login() mail veri.

 04/16/2002 1.3.2
* wrote helpfile for .set atmos (.h set_atmos) because there is no docs on how
  the atmosphere cycles, countdowns, factors work.
* put check in .set atmos for WIZ_LEVEL or above.
* really fixed the signal warnings this time on Mac OS X, and possible other
  OSes, by adding a check in the configure.
* added preliminary telopt negotiation for terminal type. added user struct 
  variables term_type and prev_term_type. Moved terms struct from main.c to
  constants.h

 04/06/2002 1.3.1
* wizlist is now created on-the-fly. It will get updated whenever a promote or
  demote or .pcreate is done. added STAFF_FILE_HEADER to hdrfiles/constants.h
  Added function do_stafflist()
* fixed --disable-optims in configure. Now it really does turn optims off! :)
* added --enable-gcc-debug in configure. Will use -g when gcc is present.
* added check for Darwin (Mac OS X) systems in configure
* added override for Mac OS X systems for NET_SIZE_T to int. configure returns
  that it can use size_t, but cc complains about incompatible pointer type and
  the manpages and includes say to use int. *shrug*
* prefixed SIG_IGN and SIG_ERR with (handler_t) as Max OS X spewed warnings 
  about them not being functions.
* fixed misc Mac OS X compile warnings
* changed login function to my_login and echo function to my_echo to eliminate
  confusion with any internal C lib functions of the same name.
* added "clipon" argument to ./shutdown script to kill the resolver clip-on

 03/26/2002 1.3.0 (new development version)
* Added fopen check to get_length(). Changed file read method from !feof loop
  to while fread.
* Return bad request in parse_input() in whowww_funcs.c if get_length failed.
* Return text/plain mimetype in get_mime_type() if filename doesn't contain 
  a .
* Moved check_var() function to check_funcs.c
* Added %webport% substitution variable to hdrfiles/constants.h
* Modified cat_to_www() to do variable substituion, and to only do it on html
  and text files.
* Modified default index.html to use substitution variables for the system's
  name, host, webport.
* Added code so that if you try to browse to a directory on the webport, it
  will cat the index.html file from that directory (if there is one), instead
  of show nothing
* Replaced old javaclient with Dave Jarvis's java terminal emulator. Going to
  the webport at http://yourhost.com:webport/connect will automatically bring
  up a java window conencting to your talker. (it's actually the index.html
  file from the webfiles/connect/ directory, with host and webport substi-
  tution variables in it)
* Updated COPYING, CREDITS, and README

 03/11/2002 1.2.3
* Added fopen checks in some resolve_funcs.c functions that didn't have them.
* Changed list_last to use file_count_lines() and file_skip_lines() instead of
  popen()ing to the tail program. I should be shot for waiting so long to
  update such a kludge!
* Added IAC case for TELOPT_ECHO, just so it doesn't say it's unrcognized
* Added newline before printed status after login/password prompt.
* Added extra delete option to cmail/csent/wipe/wwipe/gwipe/swipe functions.
  To delete between lines. i.e. to delete from line 3 to line 6 you do:
  .cmail from 3 to 6
* Changed/Added "delete except lines" option for cmail/csent/wipe/wwipe/gwipe
  /swipe functions.  Originally, to delete all lines, EXCEPT x to y, you 
  would do:
   .cmail 3 6  (so that would delete all lines except lines 3 through 6)
  NOW, to do the same thing, it's changed to this format:
   .cmail except 3 to 6
  You can also delete all lines except 1, using this:
   .cmail except 3  (delete all lines except line 3)
  The FORMER ".cmail 3 6" format will not still work for exceptions, it will 
  now process it as if you were doing ".cmail 3"
* Rearranged some configure stuff so that doing a --help does not remove your 
  current hdrfiles/config.h file

 03/04/2002
* Renamed datautils.c to datautil_funcs.c, signals.c to signal_funcs.c, and
  telopts.c to telopt_funcs.c
* Moved some more specific functions from server.c to comm_cmds.c, fileutil_
  funcs.c, and telopt_funcs.c
* For LONGLOGIN_WHO, setting to 0 now disables "who" at the login prompt.
  1 now does .swho, 2 does normal .who

 02/25/2002
* Made the login process set the ROOT_ID to the highest level on every login.
  This is in case the admin created their character before setting themselves 
  as the ROOT_ID.
* Rewrote ".h new" and wrote a set of tutorials for new users, under 
  ".h tutorial". Thanx to Jazzin for writing a couple of these.

 02/24/2002
* Moved the helpfiles "wizguide" and "newwiz" to "staffguide" and 
  "newstaff", respectively. Updated them to be more generic for a talker.
  Updated lib/newsfile with the new names.
* Updated README, README.debugging, README.quickstart, and 
  README.init_data in docs/
* Updated utils/no_make_compile script

 02/20/2002 1.2.3b-pl5
* Fixed bug of talker seg-faulting when a SMTP conversation failed, after the
  free_sock()
* Put new check in configure script to check if mkdir takes a mode argument.
* Made fmail strip_color from the mailfile lines before it emails them out.
  Thanx to Jazzin for finding this.
* Fixed "demote" helpfile because it said that you can specify the level to 
  demote to. This is not true. Fixed wrapping lines on "help" helpfile
* Wrote out messages to user doing grant/revoke notifying them of such.
  Thanx to Calysto for noticing this.
* Put in main.c and resolver_clipon.c a default umask set of 066 for -rw-------
  permissions.
* Made smtp conversation lines send \r\n because some cygwin implementations
  don't like to flush lines to the remote host with just \n *boggle*
  Thanx to Jazzin for figuring this combo out.
* Moved .guess above .guru in the command list..assuming that .gu would be 
  likely more used in hangman than as a shortcut for .guru
* Changed resolver_clipon to read up to 3 nameservers from a 
  /etc/resolv.conf file, as opposed to the previous behavior which was 
  only 1. If a bad result is read (NOT an ip that doesn't resolve) or a 
  resolution times out with a nameserver, the next will be tried. If it's 
  configure that the fallback server should be the default, it will be put 
  at the front of the nameserver list, to be tried first.

 11/29/2001 1.2.3b-pl4
* Fixed bug of talker seg-faulting when wizport was turned off (WIZ_OFFSET set
  to 0) and talker was soft-rebooted. Cause was an FD_ISSET check on a socket 
  set to -1.
* Stopped adding listening sockets to the readmask set if they are 0.
* Fixed glitch where in get_mailqueue_file, if the first fileget try failed, 
  the next fileget put the new file in the MAIN talker directory (bad sprintf)

 11/15/2001 1.2.3b-pl3
* Fixed possibility of new rwho implementation using a struct slot it shouldn't
* Fixed some typos
* Moved socket creation out of debug check (Forgot about this when i moved 
  stuff)
* Added ability to use SMTP (instead of sendmail/mail) to do external email.
  Mostly to allow external email to work on windows system, since sendmail/mail
  isn't normally available..you can specify an mail server ip and port. MAKE 
  SURE YOU CAN RELAY THROUGH THIS SERVER! (e.g. your isp mail server)
  See comments for MAILPROG variable in hdrfiles/constants.h for more info.
* Added smtp_funcs.c. Moved some alarm check_* funcs.c to check_funcs.c
* Added --enable-smtp-debug flags to the configure program. Updated Makefile.in
* Updated README.win95NT and renamed to README.windows

 10/28/2001 1.2.3b-pl2
* Added EPIPE as ok to errno_ok()
* Made resolver clipon only get suspend message when talker is set to use the
  clipon
* Made talker execute shutdown(sock, 2); on Cygwin systems, as close() does
  not work. Created SHUTDOWN() function as a macro for whether to call the 
  actual function or not.
* In resolver_client, changed all close()s to CLOSE()
* Changed tty detachment to do double-fork on Cygwin now, as it seems to be
  fixed. Moved socket binding and stdin/out/err redirecting 'til after the
  forks, as Cygwin would not bring up network the other way.
* Changed header includes in our own resolv.h as using this on Cygwin tries
  to include files that don't exist.
* Changed resolver_clipon to define _res on Cygwin systems, as Cygwin does not
  define it.
* Change rwho implementation from fork() to select-on-socket non-blocking.
  Uses miscconn[] structure

 09/13/2001 1.2.3b-pl1
* In a accept() failure, do an errno check to new function errno_ok(),
  Undocumented accept errors (such as ECONNRESET) may be non-fatal.
* Update configure script to check for res_nmkquery in -lresolv
* Update resolver_clipon.c for better portability
* Make some unsigned longs just longs to satisfy a few compiler warnings.
* Made talker REBOOT_A_CRASH now on non-signal fatals, such as select or
  accept failures.
* Made talker catch a SIGUSR2 signal and do a .reinit on it
* Updated shutdown script. -c does .reinit

 08/22/2001
* Made kill_resolver_clipon() set FROM_SERVER_READ nad FROM_SERVER_WRITE 
  to -1, because in some screwy situation they would stay at a number and
  then on a soft-reboot the clipon wouldn't get initalized/started.
* Made a failed reboot remove the REBOOTFILE.
* Added -l/listcache,-c/clearache options to the .resolve command so you
  could look at the entries in the cache and their TTL or clear the cache,
  from inside the talker.

 08/10/2001 1.2.3b
* Added configure script to try and figure out what things we need to
  compile with for OSes, what includes and functions it has, etc..
  settings will be put in hdrfiles/config.h. Added a Makefile.in file 
  which configure will use to create the Makefile.
  Run "./configure --help" for a list of options you can pass to it.
  Then run configure with the options you want (if any)
  YOU MUST RUN CONFIGURE TO GET A Makefile TO COMPILE THE TALKER
  Added an includes.h file to hdrfiles and now all C files include it 
  and config.h
* In a accept() failure, moved the FD_CLR() macro to inside the errno 
  check statement..if we don't then it might modify errno and 
  write_log() will contain innacurate info as to the reason for the 
  accept failure
* Fixed a glitch in the resolver clipon where a query that failed to 
  start would return the result for a different slot than the one we
  want. Rare to hit if the clipon is querying a valid DNS server, but
  still possible.
* Added our own snprintf function for systems that dont have it. SunOS
  to name one. Added our own ctime() function for systems that like to
  return corrupted time strings. OpenBSD to name one.

 07/16/2001 1.2.3a-pl1
* Added additional code to check libc compatability for what we should
  use for socket length, socklen_t or int. Defined a type, NET_SIZE_T,
  which we set to whatever one we deem correct (or hope is correct).

 04/14/2001
* Added a "help" keyword option to the login prompt. When entered at a
  login prompt, the user will be presented with help on how to login
  to the system, or create an account. Said text file path is defined in
  LOGINFILE in hdrfiles/constants.h and defaults to lib/loginhelp

 04/10/2001 1.2.3a
* Added a TTL field to the DNS cache entries. If you're upgrading from a
  previous version, you MUST remove your cache file (lib/sitecash) first, 
  so they'll use the TTL field right from the get-go. Added MAX_DNS_TTL 
  #define to constants.h (TTL explained briefly here) and new 
  del_from_resolver_cache() function.
* Added some filename fopen() checks in resolver_funcs.c
* Fixed a glitch in the resolver clip-on code which failed to retrieve
  a valid resolution if a CNAME/A/UNKNOWN record was found before the 
  resolution.

 01/24/2001 1.2.3draft-14
* On shutdown/reboots, kill_resolver_clipon() was executing the kill
  without checking what the value of resolver_clipon_pid was.
  This is critical, because if the resolver wasn't turned on, the pid
  would be set to -1, and kill() would execute on -1, which has the effect
  of SIGTERMing every process the user owns, including shells, and
  possibly other talkers the user has running. Fixed.
* Added BIND_INTER #define to constants.h. This lets you bind to a
  specific interface on a server with multiple interfaces. See constants.h
  for info on use.

 01/09/2001 1.2.3draft-13
* When grants/revokes were read in, any lines <= 3 characters were
  disregarded as bad, but granting/revoking a single char command id, like
  .quit (0) IS only 3 chars (0 -) so we make the check just < 3 now, to
  fix this in read_user() and read_to_user().

 12/26/2000 1.2.3draft-12
* Removed code from shutdown functions that tries to remove .pid file.
  sysud() already does this for us.
* Added write_log() of bad fopen(),opendir() to check_mess() and 
  check_total_users(). Added also to abbrcount() and many other functions
  that may exit() on startup and not leave a note of their failure. If
  these failed on reboot for some strange reason, we would never see the
  perror() because stderr is closed.
* Put additional checks in shutdown functions' reboot code when trying to
  dup() /dev/null and /dev/tty
* Did a strip_color on the say_name in suname() notice message.
* On soft-reboots, made talker ignore SIGALRM until new binary is started
  If reboot took a long time, SIGALRM would interupt the reboot and muck
  everything all up.
* Made the RWHO: log entry log user who did the rwho and host:port tried
  to retrieve

 12/05/2000 1.2.3draft-11
* Added code to have talker let resolver clip-on know when we're soft-
rebooting so clip-on doesn't exit if it catches a SIGPIPE (when it tries 
to checkpoint with the talker and fails..thereby killing us all)

 12/04/2000
* Added code to close user sockets before execing resolver clip-on in
resolver_client.c. This fixes the condition of a user socket hanging on
.quit if the clip-on was re-initialzed while they were online.
* Added check_sockets() function to check status of sockets after reboot.
This is to make sure they are still there and available, so select()
doesn't die while reading a bad descriptor.

 12/02/2000
* creply was writing the sender's message out to the receiver's tell buffer.
  Fixed.

 12/01/2000
* Found formatting glitch in resolver clip-on. Fixed.
 
 11/30/2000
* If user inputed a seach string to .who, the string would not match names
  with colors codes in them. Strip-colored the who lines before searching.
* Added logging of pid with some log entries

 11/29/2000 1.2.3draft-10
* Removed double at-sign stuff from code.
  gender,desc,fail,succ,exitm,enterm,afkmsg,user_quit,constants.h comm
  formats,www menu user changing. Added check to get_buf() to strip any
  existing ones when userfiles are read in.

 11/27/2000
* Removed the green color wrapper from MAILFROM_USER in constants.h
  because colornames in there will be fine.
* in bot_whoinfo() lowered the inpstr to compare it against .name instead
  of strip_color()ing the say_name.
* took off-the-wall check out of set_recap() that prevented sane checking
  for an odd number of color carets.
* dont strip_color() the bot log now

 11/22/2000 1.2.3draft-9
* Seperated more code into smaller C files

 11/15/2000
* Changed last_u() (.last) to check if person is invis and if doing
  user has authority to see if they're online..before sending out
  when they were last online/if they're online.

 C files CHANGED: server.c

 11/10/2000
* Changed PARSE_END_PUNC options/functionality a tad. Setting to 0 will
return a blank reaction, for people that dont want the reaction in their
comm string formatting at all. 1 will return the default SAY_REACTION for
everything, and 2 will do the parsing and return the proper emotional
_REACTION. Changed prototype and some code for get_reaction.

 protos.h CHANGES:
 Changed
  char *get_reaction(char punc);
	to
  char *get_reaction(char *inpstr);

 C files CHANGED: server.c comm_cmds.c get_funcs.c

 11/03/2000
* Starting to break code into more, smaller C files to decrease compile
times and organize better, into categories. Will go into details and
files that have changed when finished.

 10/27/2000
* in ttt_new_game() if player was ignoring NERFS, it would say you
couldn't play because user was ignoring tic-tac-toes. should checks TTTs,
not NERFSs. Fixed

 C files CHANGED: server.c

 10/26/2000 1.2.3draft-8
* Re-wrote bot to use select()/read() instead of ioctl()/read().
Initialized more signals, signal handling, prototypes for functions.
Created a write_log() function like the talker's
* Added a "+++++ WELCOME" message to server.c, to be sent to the bot on
log-in.
* Added a shutdown script to the bot directory. Modified compile script.
* Modified Makefile to make all directories in a "make dist" with
permissions of mode 700

 C files CHANGED: server.c bot/storybot.c

 10/25/2000
* Added own strptime() function called my_strptime() since not all OSes
have a strptime().
* The bot's lastcommand wasn't going to the lastcommand file in the log
directory, but the main directory. Fixed.
* The talker wasn't sending the bot any further plus-messages after a
soft-reboot. Failed to read his user number into the bot variable. Fixed.

 protos.h CHANGES:
 Added
  char *my_strptime(char *buf, char *fmt, struct tm *tmStruct);

 C files CHANGED: server.c strfuncs.c

 10/19/2000 1.2.3draft-7
* Fixed Makefile so it would recognize changes to C files and recompile
them. It wasn't doing this as of draft-6
* Fixed the cutoff of messages in write_str() when cols were set < 256. We
forgot to reget the strlen() of the string AFTER color codes were put in.
* Made read_rebootdb malloc the macro and conv buffers for the read in 
users. read_to_user() would crash the talker on soft-reboot otherwise.
* Fixed writeall_str to clear out the str2 variable in the user loop.
str2 used to be set once, but we changed it and put it in the user loop,
but forgot to clear it out every time..as of draft-5
* Added code for the "NEW" '.set who' type. I was bored. We'll see how
people like it. Added functions time_format_1() and time_format_2() to
strfuncs.c

 protos.h CHANGES:
 Added
  char *time_format_1(time_t dt);

* Put macros in protos.h to try and use sys_errlist on systems that don't
have strerror()
* Removed calls to 'ad' and 'cd' variables of a DNS HEADER structure. They are not present in all
BIND/DNS server versions. It's futile for us to check version numbers, since these variables really

 10/10/2000 1.2.3draft-5
* Added timestamp to writing of bot last command
* Changed set_recap to take color codes in recaps. Expanded say_name user
structure to length of SAYNAME_LEN, which is defaulted to 150. You
shouldn't need to change this. extended mutter user structure to length of
SAYNAME_LEN too.
* Add ".ignore colornames" functionality
* Modified comm. functions say() say_to_user(), to parse ending
puncutation of inpstr if PARSE_END_PUNC is defined as >= 1. i.e. ? at end
will put "<user> asks". reaction is gotten with new function
get_reaction(). Added to constants.h
#defines PARSE_END_PUNC, SAY_REACTION, QUESTION_REACTION,
EXCLAMATION_REACTION.
* Added #defines VIS_SHEMOTE,VIS_SHEMOTE_P,INVIS_SHEMOTE, and
INVIS_SHEMOTE_P for .shemote formatting
* Now send non-colored names to bot, except for +++++ logon: and _who
Changed bot code to pick these up, and also to use its internal user list
more, rather than the names passed to it in the inbuf.
* Fixed a bug in .pcreate that would segfault the talker in
copy_from_user (present in draft-2 and up)
* Made log entries of fork failures report the errno.
* Updated helpfiles for .listen, .ignore, and .set recap

* Made arrest require you to be a rank greater than the user you're 
arresting, or the ROOT_ID. Made sure gag_comm, muzzle, frog_user, and
anchor_user operated like this too.
* We now allow partial room names for .move
* Now if you RE-LOGIN (not a NORMAL log off/log on, when you log into
the talker when you're already on/hung) and you were in a private room, it
will not reset the room back to public and it will put you back in there
too.

  Code would not compile on systems that already had certain macros or
  functions defined in the system include libs.
* Updated README.solaris, README.quickstart, README.compiling,
  README.utils, and README
* Fixed number of arguments passed to S_WRITE in resolver_clipon code.
* Added USE_FALLBACK_AS_DEFAULT define to resolver_clipon.h. If set to 1,
  we'll use the fallback dns server instead of the local one to us.

 8/16/2000 1.2.3draft-2
* Fixed a glitch in read_resolver_reply() in the way resolver clip-on
  output was read. This caused answers from the clip-on to sporadically
  not get parsed into the users
* Made area conversation buffers malloc()ed structures instead of static.
  This will save quite a bit of memory on talkers that dont have a lot of
  rooms, since memory will only be allocated for the number of rooms
  defined in init_data, instead of MAX_AREAS.
* Made user Macros buffers malloc()ed structures instead of static.
  This will save quite a bit of memory since memory will only be allocated
  for a user when logged in.
* Changed user Macro structure. Instead of using multiple structure
  instances containing single arrays, we now use a single structure
  containing multiple arrays.
* conv_mem_get and user_mem_get now takes a mode argument to calculate
  allocated and used memory.
* in read_init_data() added code to cleanup rooms that are not used when a
  .reinit is done for less rooms that were being used. i.e. if 10 rooms
  were in use and then admin defined only 5 rooms and did .reinit, we now
  cleanup rooms 6-10. We also kick users in previous rooms, back to main
  room, since they no longer exist!
* changed the email address for code tracking to tinfo@asteroid-b612.org

 protos.h CHANGES:

operating system doesn't have them (dunno if this will remedy on all systems)
* changed resolve option in constants.h to have the site-wide cache option be the
clip-on resolver option now (I've decided not to pursue the site-wide option anymore)
* added SYS_LOOK_PENDING to constants.h
* updated docs/README.init_data for new resolve option

 6/9/2000
* If the talker crashes and lastcommand.CRASH exists, it will be appended 
to so it has a record of all lastcommands for multiple crashes
* In t_who() if idl variable is < 0, we set to 0

 5/31/2000 1.2.2b-3
* Changed format of .permission a bit. First argument is now <user>
instead of add|sub. Permissions now have extra flag of "X". "N" now means
normal access, "Y" means special access, and "X" means no access (unless
invited). Because of this change the add|sub options to .permission do
step-clearance now. Meaning, if the user has "N" access, and you "add"
more access, they get "Y". If they have "Y" access and you "sub" them,
then get "N", if you "sub" them again, they get "X". Then they would need
two "add"s to get back to "Y" again.
Allowed/Denied list now formatted better, with less blank lines and spaces
Read helpfile.
* Phased out .igtells. Moved to a .ignore option, ".ignore tells" and 
".listen tells" respectively..setting WILL be saved on logout.
Removed igtell flag read and writing from reboot DB.
The igtell user structure variable is now called tempnum1.
* modified user_wants_message() to take -1 as a user argument for getting
a setting for a non-online user after a read_user() (as in usr_stat())
* Made a few minor changes to the bot code. Also changed the compile and
restart scripts to use just /bin/sh

 protos.h CHANGES:

 5/4/2000
* Fixed bug in read_rebootdb() where ustr[].login_name wasn't read back
in. We just copy the read-in ustr[].name to it.
* Removed BOT_ROOM define in constants.h. In server.c instead of comparing
the bot room to the room the current user is in, i now compare the room
the user is in to the room the bot is in. This lets him move around the
talker out of his room and still read/listen and respond to
actions/conversation. the special cases of blank-say-is-a-review and
"help" triggers bot-help now follow the room he is in.
* Put standard +++++ notifications into the communication functions the
bot understands. i.e. if a user does a .tell to the bot, instead of using
whatever format the talker is set at by the admin, the bot gets a:
 +++++ comm_tell: username_that_said message
notification. this frees anyone from having to modify the bot's code if
they change the communication's formats from the distribution defaults!
* Made bot not get +++++ REBOOT on a soft-reboot
* Updated documentation README.compiling, BUGS, BETA-TODO, CREDITS, added
LAFK and BAFK to the .who helpfile

 constants.h CHANGES:
 Removed
#define BOT_ROOM	"pond"

 5/3/2000
* Change %y to %Y in the backup code because some C libs gave a harmless
warning saying it generates only a 2 digit year. I knew that! I didn't
need it to warn me about it! And I hate warnings, even harmless ones, so i
made it happy. :-)
* Fixed a glitch in make_sockets(). Setting a port offset to 0 and trying
to soft-reboot the talker would kick some or all of the users off, when it
shouldn't kick any off.
* Added function do_tracking() to consolidate code for sending UP and DOWN
tracking info for the talker. See function code for use.
* Added function do_timeset() to consolidate local timezone setting on
bootup and in systime() Also, found a very odd truth regarding the
setting of the TZ enviromental variable. I noticed this on glibc systems
where the set TZONE timezone would be reverted back to the normal machine
clock! After furthur research it was determined that when setting an char
array to define TZ and then putenv()ing that array to set the environment,
any furthur modification of the array resulted in the automatic change of
the environment to that modification, without needing to do a putenv()
again! This, to me, is ludicrous! If i used the array "mess" and then did
mess[0]=0; after the putenv(), the TZ variable would disappear from the
environment! But, according to the standard, it can't be touched..who
am I to argue with standards? :) the do_timeset() function along with a
static char array fixes this. NOTE: this fix only affects people that
change TZONE from localtime and that TZONE is different from local machine
time.

 Added
  void do_tracking(int mode, char *downmess);
  void do_timeset(char *zonetime);

 2/14/2000
* Updated documentation.  Added README.quickstart doc.  Updated TODO a little.

 2/1/2000 (devel: b  start of beta & feature-freeze)
* Added mode to reset_user_struct(). mode will determine if all structs get
reset or just some (actually ALMOST all). Added reset_user_struct()
to a few places where structs were reset in the function. Most notably
user_quit()
* Fixed a minor race where 2 users of the same username could be created
if in the login process at the same time. Now, whoever gets to the 
password prompt first, wins. Added check_for_creation() (1/4/2000)
* Changed conditions on email verification creation a bit. Previously if
emailver was on, a user requested verification, then emailver was turned
off, when the user came back, it'd still act as if emailver was on 'cause
they were in the verification DB. Now, when they come back they will be
treated like a normal user. When the talker is booted with emailver off or
emailver is turned off in the talker, AND a verification DB exists, the DB
will be removed.
* Phased out print_to_syslog() and logerror() functions. Replaced with 
write_log() which will write to specific logs and take variable arguments.
write_log() was under construction and in server.c. Now put in strfuncs.c
Logged more errors and try to log errno wherever possible now. Lastlogs file
will now be in the log directory, as will the lastcommand. (1/18/2000)
* Added directory "logfiles"
* Added #include <stdarg.h> to strfuncs.c so write_log() can use variable
argument functions.
* Changed promote() so ROOT_ID can promote to same level even if 
PROMOTE_TO_SAME is set to 0 (From joelie) (1/5/2000)
* player_create() changed to use a ustr[user] type struct to do it's 
variable setting instead of t_ustr. We do this so we can use 
reset_user_struct() to cut down on duplication of the resetting of all 
user variables before we set them to defaults. We also now use init_user()
to set the new user to system defaults as much as possible. (1/4/2000)
* Reset some other user structures in various places. Removed some unneed
code in login() due to a bit better function usage (1/4/2000)
* Put bot!=-5 check in write_bot() and write_bot_nr(). Without it it would
crash on cygwin32. (1/5/2000)
* Removed <sys/wait.h> from server.c since child wait stuff is in
signals.c now (1/5/2000)
* Moved frags/ into utils/code_fragments and www/ into utils/javaclient
(1/5/2000)
* Put comments before auth_xxxx() functions and rearranged their flow
according to execution. Re-coded parts of them to use better methods to 
set non-blocking and to check for readability/writability. Added error
logging. Added write timeout variable. THere was no sense to have a read 
timeout variable if you're gonna select() the writability of the socket
forever, Arctic! write timeout set to 6 seconds. read reset to 3.
(1/7/2000)
* Set all ports to be passed as (unsigned short) to htons() (1/7/2000)
* Set bootup to get logged even if we're in debugging mode.
 ** System running ** message will not show in debugging mode. (1/7/2000)
* Zeroed ALL bind addresses before creating in make_sockets() (1/7/2000)
* Changed user_quit() to kill() a child remote who if it exists for a
user, instead of waiting for it to die before closing the connection. If a
user was in a remote who and a shutdown was performed, the shutdown would
hang until the child exited..not exactly the behaviour we want (1/11/2000)
* Jazzin pointed out that if you were afk, then did a remote who, the
"you're back" message would print twice. This was caused by us not forcing
a flush of the user's queue before the fork(). Also, the "you may
play while you wait" message would not show up until the remote who
succeeded/failed, for the same reasons. Fixed. (1/11/2000)
* Added define checks for OpenBSD to get rid of some socket call and 
ANSI C warnings. Thanx for the OpenBSD account, ziffnab. (1/12/2000)
* Added logfiles directory creation in Makefile "dist" section
* Updated README.compiling
* Added functionality for soft-rebooting. This will reboot the binary
without disconnecting the users or losing their current information (I
guess you could call it hot-rebooting) User data will be written to a db,
binary executed, then db read back into the proper user slots. The -r 
option of shutdown will now do soft-reboots. -h will now do the previous
hard-reboot. Soft-reboot sets a "restarting" variable, so listening
sockets dont get reopened with the new binary, since they don't get closed
to begin with. Changed the outputting of some messages and colsolidated
some if()s in check_shut() Added define REBOOTFILE, which is the db that
will be written, read, then removed on soft-reboot. Updated shutdown
helpfile. (1/15/2000)
* Modified "help" helpfile (.h help) to be a short guide to the help
system and to the syntaxes of commands in the command's helpfile.
(1/15/2000)
* Had check_var check for hostname and main port var. See HOST_VAR and
MAINPORT_VAR
* Tweaked out soft-rebooting some more. (1/17/2000)
* restart, shutdown, and helpfiles/TOP now run from sh instead of csh
* If we go down or reboot from an error (shutdown_error()) we're gonna try 
and move the lastcommand file to lastcommand.CRASH
* Added backup_logs() function which will get called from check_mess() at
midnight to backup/rename all logs to a new subdirectory under LOG_DIR
Added trim_backups() function which will also get called from check_mess()
at midnight to trim logs to x days (set as TRIM_BACKUPS). Called by staff
as .backup (function backup_stuff()) Added option to init_data
to set on or off initially. Added .backup helpfile (1/18/2000)
* modified/enhanced .readlog to take in account new log file
format/writing. Added 2 temp. user structures log_stage and temp_buffer.
log_stage will hold the log number we're reading while in cat() prompting.
temp_buffer will hold the search string/number of lines. These are needed
because the user may specify to cat/search all files, which requires us to
return into the function on our own (w/o user intervention) after each
file is catting. Updated helpfile (1/19/2000)
* changed the ranks structure. This now contains the fields lname (long
rank name), sname (short rank name), abbrev (1 letter/number/character
abbreviation), and odds. Changed .who listing to use abbrevs and/or short
name where appropriate. Removed old RANKS define, odds[], and ranks[]
arrays. (1/19/2000)
* changed the way partial queue flushes are done. j_mess no longer used,
because of the limited size. output_size now is alloced_size the total
size we want to send..this doesn't decrese. new temp user struct variable
write_offset contains how far we are in write()ing. debug messages for
queue flushes and queue_writes no longer contain the buffers. (1/25/2000)
* rechecked the string-terminating character in get_input(). We should be
able to handle CR, LF, or CRLF. Added some code to try and do this.
(1/24/2000)
* tweaked soft-rebooting. make_sockets is now done after everything else
(but before forking). reboot db is read before make_sockets() This is so
if the talker is compiled and soft-rebooted with port offsets different
than the previously running binary, the ports can be open or closed. i.e.
binary was running with WHO port open, then compiled with WHO offset of 0,
meaning closed, soft-reboot done, talker detects port was open but needs
to be closed for new boot, so closes it (1/25/2000)
* added some checking in get_input() for read() returning -1. If a network
error, we call user_quit() silently (no output to user) and forego any
furthur socket flushes. This should get handle most of the "Broken pipe"
errors from write() which are normal, but just annoy me. BE ADVISED, for
silent mode user_quit() now has a new "mode" parameter passed to it!

 C files CHANGED: ALL

 12/15/99
 Added logging of auto-expires, auto-expire nukes, manual-expire
nukes, and auto-nukes

 12/01/99 (devel: pl5)
 Rewrote the way data is written down to a www socket, just like the
user sockets (5/10/99 entry). The web port wasn't working on glibc,
but worked fine on libc5. Added relevant variables.
* Added code and changes to wwport after get_input() call in server.c
* Added cat_to_www() function, modified parameter to user instead of sock
in server.c
* Modified free_sock() to reset output_data and output_size in server.c
* Modified init_misc_struct() to reset output_data and output_size in
datautils.c
* Added write_str_www(), queue_write_www(), queue_flush_www() in
strfuncs.c
* Change cat_to_sock() call to cat_to_www() in whowww.c
* change write_it() calls to write_str_www() with user pass instead of
sock pass in whowww.c
* change external_www() call to pass user instead of sock.
* expanded size of wwwport[].file by 12 to support adding on of server
type to be parsed later
* added new realloc macros and add new data on to malloced
user/wwwstructure using memcpy()
* Included string.h instead of strings.h for linux
* defined __STRICT_ANSI__ before including sys/socket.h on glibc systems
since it produces a warning due to a glitch in the system include file.
* www reading was changed so that the head GET line isn't parsed until
after the browser sends a blank line..this is how it's usually done.
Previously, we read right after we got the head line in.
* updated TODO, README.win95NT, and helpfiles for ".site" and ".cline"

 C files CHANGED: ALL except telopts.c

 11/12/99
 Added ifdef check for setpgrp on OSF/Digital systems. Digital requires
arguments passed to setpgrp();
 Include <string.h> or <strings.h> in resolve.c depending on system.
 Fixed warning in systime() of passing strlen() calculated values to a
field width on systems that dont define a strlen() return as int.
 Fixed some warnings in whowww.c of passing strlen() values to a
conversion on systems that dont define a strlen() return as int.

 11/8/99
 Added trimbackups.c script to utils directory. Compile with "make all" or
"make trimbackups" This program is used to remove backups older than days
specified on command line. Type program by itself for arguments it
requires, or see updated README.backups file.
 Removed rm -f server.pid from restart script. Talker overwrites the file
on startup.

 8/24/99 (stable: pl3  devel: pl4)
 Fixed memory overwrite in .wlog that causes a segfault when staff gives
a long inpstr.
 Fixed glitch in revoking .say where the first word of chat was cut off.
 constants.h CHANGES: MAX_WWW_CONNECTS now should default to 5
 text.h CHANGES: none

 8/4/99 pl3 (stable: pl2  devel: pl3)
 Fixed a glitch that let users with .say revoked still say messages as
long as they just typed it and didn't use .say
 Made it so that if a user has .wiztell revoked they wont see wiztells
either. Also if they have .wiztell granted, they will also see wiztells.
 Made it so that a .greet with special characters errors out instead of
showing the room just blank lines.
 constants.h CHANGES: none
 text.h CHANGES: none
 protos.h CHANGES: none
 authuser.h CHANGES: none

 7/12/99 pl2
 Fixed a bug that caused the talker to segfault on blank username file
open. Should C really allow a directory to be opened with fopen()???
 tinfo tracking now sends process PID too to be sure it updates the right
talker entry (in case multiple running with same SYSTEM_NAME)
 Fixed hole in .site which allows . (dot) files to go through and segfault
the talker.

 7/1/99 1.2.2a-pl1
 Made code more compliant with glibc2. It was segfaulting in an FD_ISSET
when it tried to check for a socket in a writemask, and the socket wasn't
being used. Changed get_input() to a return type of int (was char *) and
evaluated return value in switch statement. If socket is -1 after get_input
the user is gone and no need to check for the socket in the writemask.
 Removed DEBUG define. To make talker NOT fork to background for
debugging, just use the -d switch on the command line. i.e.
 ./server -d or ./server <config file> -d
 Added function get_iac_string to return string versions of IAC numbers to
the system log.
 Made it so that you can abort a talker addition (.talker -a) by typing a
q/Q by itself on any entry line. Made it so that a \n isn't written to the
end of the addition prompts.
 Updated compiling README, TODO, and CREDITS

 5/28/99
 Cleaned up a few glitches.
 Put DEBUG define's in Makefile instead of in .c files. 
 Put all main external who/www functions in whowww.c
 Finished POST method for web port.
 Added _login function to web port
 Started adding functionality to web port login to allow reading and
changing of a user's preferences.

 5/10/99
 Added count calculation in t_who() for friends .who formatting. Thanx
Joelie.
 Added brackets around in if in syssign(). Function was telling bot twice
that a user was logged in. Thanx Joelie.
 Rewrote the way data is written down to a user socket. Inspired by a
problem with gmud, where the talker sends data faster than the client is
ready to receive it. We now use select to poll the user sockets for
WRITEability. until a user socket is marked as such by select(), data will
be queued up in a malloced/realloced user structure 
ustr[user].output_data. When marked, all data will be sent down it
possible. If only some goes, the rest will go when the socket is next
marked writable. malloced space will be freed when struct is empty. This
works but is still in testing for problems/memory leaks. Added funcs
queue_write() and queue_flush()

 5/4/99
 .to direct emote/possesive emotes now handle spaces better.
 Also, if user you're .to'ing to is invis, they will show up as so as per
INVIS_TALK_LABEL.
 Made the code so that if you set a port offset (i.e.
WIZ_OFFSET,WWW_OFFSET,WHO_OFFSET) to 0 that port wont bind/listen/startup
on talker boot. modified functions main(), make_sockets(), and 
system_access() to make this work.
 Fixed .sthink where the output wasn't being written to the user's
conversation buffer. Little thing i forgot to put back in.

 4/25/99 1.2.1
 Updated and added all relevant helpfiles.
 Added timestamps to restricts and unrestricts in logs, and logging of
creation attempts from bannewed sites.
 Changed format of default ".set" listing. options now shown in 2 columns
with no descriptions to save space. Help for options still under .h
set_<option>
 Added ".set pause" for toggling of the pause during the login sequence. Added
set_pause(). Moved .autofwd and .autoread to .set autofwd and .set autoread
 Added mode option to check_site() to specify ip check or hostname check. IP substring
checks will now match from beginning of restricted site, instead of just anywhere in
site.
 Added .to direct emotes/possesive emotes. Added VIS_DIREMOTES and INVIS_DIREMOTES
defines
 Added VIS_SEMOTES,VIS_SEMOTES_P,VIS_SEMOTES_M,VIS_SEMOTES_MP,
INVIS_SEMOTES,INVIS_SEMOTES_P,INVIS_SEMOTES_M,INVIS_SEMOTE_MP,
VISFROMSEMOTE,VISFROMSEMOTE_P defines
 Added multi-tells,semotes,sthinks,brings Added MAX_MULTIS define to regulate
how many simultaneous people can be in a multi-com. 
 Added .ftell and .femote. Can also use .tell -f and .semote -f to achieve
same results
 Added the .ttt (tic-tac-toe) .hangman and .guess (for hangman) commands.
 Added the following structures for these command: ttt_kills (saved), 
ttt_killed (saved), ttt_board, ttt_playing, ttt_opponent, hang_wins
(saved), hang_losses (saved), hang_stage, hang_word, hang_word_show,
hang_guesses. Added some constant strings to constants.h for new commands.
 Added saved user structure "icq", .set icq, and icq info to .examine
 Added 9 miscellaneous saved structures for future expansion. 4 text, 5
numeric. Changed UDATA_VERSION to 122.ver
 Changed the way ints,longs,and time_ts are gotten with rval() rlong() and
rtime(). Added funcs getint() and getlong()
 Added ROOM_LEN and RANK_LEN that determine spacing for some commands. .rooms, .who to
name two
 Fixed hidden room spacing in .ustat

 4/3/99
 Added -n option to .users to just count the users (as per calysto's request)

 3/26/99 pl13
 Finished the color counting in count_color();
 Finished the NUTS and IFORMS .set who types.
 The NUTS type is "slightly" different than the real NUTS 3 formatting.
 There is only 1 space before the name (for invis flag) instead of 2 (2nd
is used for nuts remote users). There's no spaces between the :'s and most
variables (to save space). If users aren't at a level where they can see
user levels in .who (NUTS shows the level by default, we dont) They'll see
the user status in that field "Awke" "Idle" "AFK", etc..
 Changed WHO_LEVEL default to level 1.

 3/23/99
 Added functions convert_color(char *str) to strfuncs.c and related
declarations. This is used to convert color codes to HTML color codes for
viewing on the webpage in the user webinfo and who's online info.
Multiple spaces in user profiles are now converted to multiple nbsp's on
the webpage.
 Fixed glitch in webport where bgcolor name in webport.cfg was showing up
as BACKGROUND body tag instead of BGCOLOR.
 Removed the .hilite command. Just use ^text^ instead! :)

 3/17/99
 Let EAGAIN errnos continue on accept() failure. Now log to syslog errno
number along with strerrno.
 default VIS_MUTEMOTE and INVIS_MUTEMOTE now have no space between user
and action. A space was cropping up between the username and ' when a
possesive muttered emote was being done. Fixed mutter() to distiguish and
space accordingly.
 Added some function declarations to protos.h to take care of warnings
from strict -Wmissing-prototypes compiler option.

 3/9/99 pl12
 Fixed the TF (and possibly other clients) problem where lines without
newlines aren't shown. i.e. login prompt, password prompt, entpro line
prompts, paging prompts. We ask the client if we can do EOR (End Of
Record) with telnet_ask_eor()..if so, we send EORs after said prompts with
telnet_write_eor()..if not, we send GAs (Go Aheads) as a backup. Added
temp int structure ustr[user].promptseq to hold their preference while
online.
 Hidden passwords now work right with locked AFKs

 2/13/99
 Added a check in nerf() to see if the person being nerfed has the nerf
command, so they can fight back!

 2/1/99 pl11
 on a .search, it will search hidden message boards for you if you are at
or above GRIPE_LEVEL. Previously, it just ignored these boards.
 Rewrote .revoke and relevant structures, added .grant. Added temp
structure ustr[user].tempsuper. Replaced relevant ustr[user].super's with 
ustr[user].tempsuper in command functions, to work with .grant.
 Added timestamps to some log entries that previously didn't have them.
 in .ranks, your rank line will be colored

 1/28/99
 Added a new #define called UDATA_VERSION in constants.h. This represents the
version of our user data files (in user/) An increment in the version
number means that new user, saved, structs were added to the user's
datafile format. The version now appears in the first line of the user's
file. Files conversions are done using this by comparing the current
version with the one in the file. Make sure to read the new 
README.converting in the docs/ directory. Added function convert_file()
to do the actual conversion. Upon booting of code carrying a new file
version, userfiles will be converted at boot time (in reset_userfors())

 1/21/99
 Added a #define called DEF_DOMAIN in constants.h. We tack this onto the
end of the hostname if a getdomainname() fails. the getdomainname() code
has changed some to make almost 100% sure we can get a hostname/domainname
combo for the web port and whereever else it's used.
 Added a fix for glibc systems using .w @. A .w @ on these systems would
succeed but the child process would segfault trying to close a user socket
that didn't exist. This didn't show up in the talker, just in the log and
is generally not good.
 Added comment in README.compiling about make'ing on multiprocessor
systems.

 1/20/99 pl10
 Added a #define check in the fork(). openbsd doesn't recognize setpgrp()
as taking no arguments. we use setpgrp(0,0) on those systems.

 1/2/99
 Added a macro #define for compiling on glibc systems. compiler reports 
warnings on some socket calls, argument 3. size types changed from int to
socklen_t.

 12/25/98
 Fixed the display of the expire setting in ".auto settings" as per
Jazzin's find. Thanx.

 12/24/98
 Talker will now detect 0 length userfiles, remove them, and log the
action accordingly. a 0 length userfile used to crash the talker on
reboot. There shouldn't be any of these there to begin with! but if a
server disk fills up and no longer lets us write our files, this will
occur, hence the need for checking. Changes are in read_user()
read_to_user() reset_userfors() quit_multiples() and login()
 added #define COLOR_DEFAULT. Sets whether color is on or off for new
users by default.

 12/9/98 pl9
 For .entpro, users can now do a .s, .r, .v, or .a on a line by itself
instead of doing . then s, r, v, or a. Both ways will work.
 Updated .entpro helpfile

 11/9/98 pl8
 Added new TEMP user struct "short int needs_hostname" for hostname
resolution via caching.
 Added functions cache_lookup(user) and request_cache_lookup(user) of type
int for hostname resolution via caching.
 Added additional option "2" to resolve_names global. This option will do
hostname reoslution via a master daemon run as a seperate program on the
machine which can be used for all talkers on that machine (provided they
configure their code correctly). Option "1" now becomes a talker-wide site
cache which just belongs to your specific talker.
 resolve_names_on() and resolve_names_off() were changed to a toggle
command function resolve_names_set();
 added SITECACHE_FILE, this is the main talker cache file for resolving
ips->hostnames when only using talker-wide resolution
 added SITECACHE_FILE_DEF, this is the default cache file for
resolving ips->hostnames when only using talker-wide resolution. The
entries in this file and entered manually. This file exists so particular
sites that we KNOW dont resolve right dont get bumped from the main cache
and try to get resolved again. (not mentioning any names...NOMAD!)
 added SITECACHE_SIZE, this is the number of entries that will be put into
the main cache file on talker-wide resolutions before we start bumping
sites from the top of the file.
 added SITE_WIDE_CACHE_FILE, this is the main cache file that all talkers
(if more than 1) will use for resolving ips->hostname.
 added SITE_WIDE_REQUEST_FILE, this is the main queue file that all
talkers (if more than 1) will use for sending unresolved ips to the master
daemon to be resolved.
 these 2 files MUST be readable and writable by the owner (or more
preferably group) that the talker programs are running as (usually the
"users" group)

 10/29/98 pl7
 Did check for .succ message length in tell_user() and other private comm.
commands so that if a user clears their message, the sender doesn't get a
blank line in response, just nothing now.
 Added feature that will warn users by email so many days (set by TIME_TO_GO) before
they're going to be auto-expired. Changed AUTO_EXPIRE define to accomodate new
features. See constants.h for info on TIME_TO_GO and AUTO_EXPIRE. File emailed to users
is in lib/nukewarn
 Added feature that lets you put variables in outputted text files. For example if you
insert the variable %system% in a text file, when called it will output the SYSTEM_NAME
variable, or maybe %user% will output ustr[user].say_name.
 Changed .log that you can view up to 100 lastlogs
 Changed login quote,.quote,.nslookup,.finger,.whois, and any other parts
of the code where system() was used to now use popen() instead.
 Got to compile cleanly and run on Digital UNIX 4.0 with -Wall -pedantic
 Added detection of -s subject switch in MAILPROG and adjust the envelope
accordingly.

 10/16/98
 Finished function declarations in protos.h
 Calysto finished ANSI declarations in server.c
 Fixed some bad casts to functions.

 9/22/98
 Added helpfiles for .anchor and .auto made by Calysto
 Removed old helpfiles for .autopromote and .autonuke
 Moved function declarations into a lib file, protos.h
 You can now specify color names in the webport.cfg file along with hex
color codes. Names are like red, black, blue, etc..

 9/13/98
 ".ignore topics" now ignores the Topic line in .look too. Dont know why
Deep never added that in the original Iforms.

 9/1/98
 Optimized code to compile with -Wall -pedantic. So far only tested on
 Linux.
 Added quit_multiples(); function to disconnect multiple same-name users
on pre-login. Used mutter structure to hold string temporarily for
add_user();
 Took su part out of add_user();
 Users dont show up on who listings anymore when they're at the pre-login
stage

 8/24/98
 Fixed reset user structure in login(). Nothing big.

 8/20/98
 Fixed memory overwrite bugs in check_for_user() and logerror()

 8/4/98
 Changed INC_LOGIN to NO_NEW_LOGIN
 Removed the #define LOGIN_PROMPT

 7/9/98
 Inserted a new #define PAUSE_LOGIN in constants.h
If set to 1, on login, users will get the "--- Press return to complete
login ---" string/pause before they go into the room. If set to 0, users
will jump right through like the old code used to be. 
 Added function add_user2() to make the previous easier to implement.

 6/22/98
 Fixed glitch in .cline in trying to clear who and www ports.

 6/16/98
 Fixed buffer overwrite bug in set()
 Updated documentation in docs/
 Added helpfiles for set_picurl set_who and set_help

 5/18/98
 Fixed a bug in remote .look's where the lock status of the remote room
was showing the lock status of the room currently in. Thanx jazzin and
kyla.

 5/4/98
 Added .revoke command. added user substructures for this command, namely ustr[user].revokes
and ustr[user].revokes_num.
 Cleaned up some remote who stuff. Jazzin updated remote who talker list.
 Web server now has basic POST method functionality. Web server config file has 3 more line
options. Read comments.
 Added some more substructures in wwwport[] struct.
 Users that have their connection hung and relog on (which terminates the previous session)
now get the .tell/.semote buffer and .call'd user (if there is one) from that session in
their new login. Online time is not restored to the new login, but is added to their 
cumulative time and saved to disk as old session is closed.

 4/21/98
 Told the bot when someone logged on so he can greet them.
 Added story-last-changed dates to list of stories bot gives.
 Added some more actions and #defines to the bot and fixed him with the 1.2 code.

 4/16/98
 Removed TELNET_TO #define. I'm able to pull the info from memory now.
 Added #define WEBCONFIG which defines the files that contains
configurable settings for the web server port.
 The web server port now can give info on users of the talker in
real-time. http://host:webport/_users creates a page of letters to
choose users from. From those pages, you can go to specific user pages.
Each user page contains data pulled right from the user's data files.
If they have their ".set picurl" set, it will import their picture into
their page also. There's also a searchable user form too.
 Font colors, link colors, background color/image, and header/footer
files are set in the file defined as WEBCONFIG. Read the comments in
that file.
 The web _who function now also takes the same settings from the
WEBCONFIG file. Also, the link from user goes to their user info instead of their webpage.
"Send Email" link also removed because that would be in their user info page too.
 You can change settings in the WEBCONFIG file while the talker is
running. For them to take immediate effect, type .reinit in the talker.
This means that there are new change in read_init_data()

 4/14/98
 Added mime types file mimetype.cfg for the web server parse
function to evaluate request file types against mime encodings, so as to
make sure files get sent out as the type they are to the browser.
 #define VERSION2 removed. Updated info for .version is gotten in real
time by the last modification date on the server binary (which is almost
always the last time it was compiled). Added "thisprog" global
 The pid file is now written out by which program is running. Previously,
if you started a.out it would overwrite server.pid. Now it will write to
a.out.pid or thisprog.pid

 4/10/98
 Tweaked out the remote who code a bit.
 Restricted users to doing only 1 remote who at a time. If they could do more they
could possibly fill up the process table on the machine and crash the machine. Added
temp struct ustr[user].rwho to hold the PID of the child process they're running.

 4/1/98
 Added reset_user_struct() function to reset user variables before a
login, so if they login to a username incorrectly, it doesn't keep that
user's flags in memory for the next user logging in. More of a safety
precaution, than anything.
 Added emptying of more flags in init_user_struct(). Noticed a little
glitch in how the brackets were balanced out and fixed.
 Strtolower()'d the username entered at login time.

 3/31/98
 Fixed syslog formatting glitch in .auto functions

 3/29/98
 Fixed output of kill message on kill to all users.
 did some work to internal web server
 fixed singular/plural discrepincy in auto-nuke message
 updated .allow_new helpfile
 fixed bug in sent mail message when wiz promotes user

 3/24/98
 Gagged users can no longer do and .examine or .ustat of a user.
 Web port enhanced to take requests from browsers as a real web server.
Talker web pages can be put in the "webfiles" directory. So if your web
port is 5030. Your talker homepage would be http://yourhost.com:5030/
it goes for what MAIN_PAGE is set at in constants.h as the main page.
This is still in alpha also. It hasn't been tested with cgis or server
side includes or forms or anything like that.
The former web-formated WHO listing is at (if your webport is 5030)
http://yourhost.com:5030/_who
 .ptell .picture and .greet have been moved to level 1. 
 added functions include get_input() parse_input() get_length() get_type()
 web_error()
 added #defines include WEBFILES MAIN_PAGE BAD_REQUEST NOT_FOUND NO_HEADER
and HEADER

 3/10/98
 Code now in alpha testing for Windows 95/NT. #define for it is in constants.h. Be sure to
read docs/README.win95NT
 Added local hostname/domainname/ostype generation code in main()
 Added macro functions S_READ S_WRITE and CLOSE to constants.h for read,write,and close
functions depending on whther we're running on unix or win32 OS. Replaced all C calls with
the new macros.
 Fixed .log color discrepency. Thanx joelie.

 3/7/98
 All emails coming from the talker are now RFC compliant. Meaning valid headers are passed to
the mail program. The mail program should be sendmail for everybody, otherwise a program that
will accept standard input and a period to end the message. Normal "mail" can be
used if you really need to. The mail program is opened via popen() which is a lot
better way of doing it than system(). For autofordwarded messages, the mail will appear
to come from the user with their email in the from header so the recipient can respond
to the .smail just like it was a normal email from the person.
 Added SYSTEM_EMAIL which is the email address talker emails come from (not .smail autofwds)
 Alert checks for friends logging on or coming back from afk are shown to you now even if
you're ignoring logins or afks messages.
 Fixed generate_password() so that generated password is always 3 or more characters in
length.

 3/2/98
 Moved backup, restore, and backupd to utils/ directory
 Added more checks for users being frogged. .btell, .sos, etc, etc..

 2/27/98
 Removed the .<owner> command from the code. It was just one extra things to configure and
really served no GOOD purpose.

 2/25/98
 Changed putenv() in .time function from putenv("TZ=localtime"); to
putenv("TZ=:/etc/localtime"); for FreeBSD and NetBSD systems. They don't
have a localtime symbolic link to its current timezone, so this is
required. 

 2/24/98
 Changed #define SYS_FULL from a global to a file. #define SYSFULLFILE
"lib/sysfullfile"
 Added cat_to_sock(filename,accept_sock) function
 -traditional was removed from compiler flags by default

 2/23/98
 Fixed .nuke bug hopefully. Added .afk alerts to .alert. Meaning, if someone on your .alert
list goes afk, when they come back from being afk you will be alerted like when they log in.
 In a social, if the receiving user is in the room with you and invisible, it will now show
the value of INVIS_ACTION_LABEL instead of their name..duh cygnus

 2/15/98
 Made NEW_ROOM a room name. The room number is the new_room global in
the code and is found using read_init_data()

 2/12/98
 Fixed auto-expire. It wasn't working at midnight. It helps if you open
the user directory before you try and read it! duh!
 Replaced returns in get_rwho() with exit(0);
 Tweaked socket coding a bit. Added some FD_CLR()s

 2/8/98
 Fixed select() and .samesite bug. Investigating bug with auto-expiring.
 Investigating bug with .monitors on incoming logins.
 Cut command name/level header (2 lines) off command helpfiles. Talker now
generates that header itself.

 12/31/97
 Finished email verification.
 Added prompt to a login where user will be
shown their status before they enter the room on the talker, and press
ENTER to complete their login. This required moving some code from
add_user() into login()
 Took out examine() function. .examine will now point to a mode of
usr_stat() was usr_stat(user,inpstr), now usr_stat(user,inpstr,mode)
the .examine will have the less statistical info in it, and .ustat the
opposite. Took out USTAT_PROFILE. profiles will always be shown in
.examine because it's short now. Took our nerf_stat() function and .nstat.
Info now fits in .ustat
 Took out QUOTE_MESS. Can be just hardcoded.
 Took out HELPSTYLE. Users specify now with .set help
 Made IS_PRIVATE1 and IS_PRIVATE2 into IS_PRIVATE
 Added .anchor <user> <time> to anchor a user down to a room..and
respective structures ustr[user].anchor, ustr[user].anchor_time, 
ANCHORED_DOWN, ANCHORON_MESS, ANCHOROFF_MESS, and ANCHOR_CANT
 
 12/19/97
 Added VERIINSTRUCT, VERINSTRUCT2, VERIFILE, VERIEMAIL, PASEMAIL_VERIFY,
and EMAIL_VERIFY #define's. There is a new level for .allow_new which
requires the user give an email before an account is made. Their
password..random..will be mailed to them there, they will re-enter the
talker and verify themselves with that password. VERIINSTRUCT is the
file catted out to a new user on how to get their account through
email. VERIFILE is the file which keeps track of non-verified
(pending) accounts. These, if not verified in a day's time will be
deleted. RE-READ README.init_data
 Jazzin added .auto command. 1 command for .autopromote,.autonuke, and
.autoexpire
 We now keep how many users we expired (either by an auto-expire or
.expire -n) in memory while talker is up. Counter is shown in .system
 (system_stats.tot_expired)
 .system 1/0 flags changed to YES/NO/ON/OFF

 12/13/97
 Made samesite case-INsensitive
 Added auto_expire() function and #define AUTO_EXPIRE

 10/11/97
 Took out cyg_crypt() since noone really uses it (everyone uses st_crypt) 
and we wont have to worry about anyone needing a crypt library for their compiler
since we use our own encryption.
 Started changing help() to use user structure ustr[user].help
 IFORMS and NCOHAFMUTA (OURS) help types are done, NUTS2 and NUTS3 to go yet.

 10/1/97
 Fixed buffer overrun in logerror()
 Fixed bug in ".force <user> email <a blank>" that corrupted the user's data 
file.
 Moved mapfile from helpfiles/map to lib/mapfile
 Adding ".ignore beeps" NOW, make sure this is understood. If you turn beeps 
on for private comm. with ".set beeps" and have ".ignore beeps" on, you will 
NOT get beeps. It's like you're contradicting yourself :)
 .beep now is a mode of tell_usr..sorta (mode 1) but still has it's own 
function for !strlen(inpstr) check first.
 BEEPS mode add for writeall_str()
 COME_TELEMESS and GO_TELEMESS for the messages for people telelporting in 
and out. (defaults are "arrives in a blinding flash!" and "disappears in a 
shimmer of light!")

 9/22/97
 When you add an atmos with .addatmos the atmospheres in the file 
numerically sort themselves from lowest to highest in case someone 
doesn't add them that way initially (which DOES happen).
 Now when you do a .delatmos on a atmos file that contains only 1 atmos, 
the file will be deleted instead of being left empty.
 When someone .bring's or .move's an invis user..the user's identity is 
left masked to the old room and new room occupants. Before, it showed you 
the name of the shadow being brought or moved.
 Added INVIS_MOVES to stands for the common "Something disturbs the air" 
shown when a shadow moves in or out of a room.
 .rooms list is paged out now, instead of continuous.

 9/17/97
 Moved .wlog to level 1. let's USERS read their own warnings and that's it.
updated helpfile.
 A .suname now logs the name change to the user's new/name-changed warning log

 9/14/97
 Made .clist and .readlog searches case IN-sensitive
 Some minor mods to external_www()
 Added structs for who and web port connects, mostly for .site to see if any 
connections are left open. Added MAX_WWW_CONNECTS global.
 Added SUB_BANNAME global to let admins set whether they want banned names 
to be banned exactly or by sub-strings. Read the comments in constants.h for 
more details.

 9/4/97
 Added typedef Macro structure into constants.h. Macros now have a macro 
name and body. This is to implement macro substitutions. Macros now are 
shown AND added AND deleted with .macro  Macros can be the normal .0 .1, 
etc.. or a name like .mymacro up to 11 characters including the .
Substitutions are done with $1, $2 and $3. Yes, only 3 arguements you cna 
pass. Any after 3 would be tacked onto the end. Read the helpfile on 
.macro for more info. Rewrote check_macro to do substitution processing.
Added NUM_MACROS and MACRO_NLONG to constants.h
 Increased max output butter for user to 7 lines, 560 characters.

 8/29/97
 Removed shutdown_it(). shutdown_error(10) will take care of it's job.
 Added case 10 (SIGTERM,SIGUSR1) case 11 (SIGSEGV) and case 12 (SIGBUS) to
shutdown_error(). shutdown_error() will perform a reboot if SIGSEGV or
SIGBUS occurs and REBOOT_A_CRASH #define in constants.h is 1.
 Added handle_sig() function to do signal handling.
 Added another toggle option to ".set hi" The new option will allow your
incoming private communication to be normal with color in it, instead of
just all hilitied.

 8/28/97
 Added another toggle option to .autoread for just reading new mail when
you get it and are online. Added 2 toggle options to .monitor so you can
see incoming connections before a user logs in. Updated helpfiles.

 8/27/97
 for .expire -n, all nukes won't get wiztelled. Just one wiztell that a
person did an expire will be shown.
 added functions remove_exem_data() to remove usernames from expire exempt
file when users are nuked,autonuked,suicide, or any other form of
destroying, change_exem_data() to change a name in the expire list from
one to another (for set_recap() and suname())
 .expire -e now shows how long ago the user was on, next to their name.
 remove_user() now removes all files for user, not jsut the data file so
I don't hafta remove their other files in 4 different places.
 
 8/24/97
 Added message to login to tell user to wait if talker is in process of
booting or doing a system check at midnight.
 Added checks to user_quit() to reset user if they cut connection or get
.killed in the middle of profile/votedesc/roomdesc.
 Made some minor mods to check_mess()

 8/20/97
 Added ".look <room>", updated helpfile.
 Changed Makefile so only have to uncomment 1 def for sunos, bsdi,
freebsd, netbsd, and linux. #if's in the .c file now check which OS we're
running under.
 Added MAX_SMAILSIZE so admins can change different from MAX_MAILSIZE how
big they want sent mail files to get. the max mailfile size default was
changed from 65000 to 50000 in constants.h The sentmailfile size default
was made 40000.
 MAILFILE_NOTIFY and MAILFILE2_NOTIFY now tell the person how much they
are over the size limit.

 8/9/97
 Added SYS_PASSWD_INVA global to tell user on login when their password in
invalid (no password given, password less than 3 characters, first letter
of password less than ASCII 32). Also used in supass() and password()
ditto on SYS_PASSWD_LONG now.
 FROG_TALK, FROG_EMOTE, FROG_SEMOTE, FROG_ECHO globals replaces 'Ribbit,
ribbit' and those other frog messages in server.c
 Users that try and xcomm users of same or higher rank now dont get the
xcomm put on themselves.
 .pcreate now REQUIRES a password. As does creating a new account. This
also solves the tintin problem with CRs and LFs.

 8/8/97
 Added int gagged_types[x] to constants.h to let admins define which
message types a .gag on a user gags (i.e. if user X gags user Y and user X
is in the same room with user Y and SAY_TYPE is a gagged_type, user Y
won't see a user X .say .emote .to, etc.. GET IT? GOT IT? GOOD. )
 Moved message types #defines along with their respective flag_names
struct to constants.h
 Added INVIS_ACTION_LABEL which is the person string name given to an
invisible user (i.e. "A mysterious shadow");
 Added INVIS_TALK_LABEL which is the voice string given to an invisible
user in communication, mostly says and tells? (i.e. "A mysterious voice")
 Added STAFF_PREFIX so admins can change the prefix that goes in wiztells
and messages sent to wizzes from the talker.
 Made possesive commands now require that you type your possesiveness in.
So a  .say 'talker is cool  which outputted "Cygnus's talker is cool"
has changed to a  .say 's talker is cool
This is so you can do possesives like 'll 'd and whatever else there is.
 Everyone on the talker is notified of Name changes IF the person whose
name was changed is online.
 Fixed age old thing where if a user is hidden and they go afk or bafk, or
come back from afk or bafk their name would be shown in the message to
everyone instead of 'A shadow' or whatever. Took me 3 years to figure out
that did that. :-)
 Made some minor changes to .smail internally

 8/7/97
 Moved .color and .visemail to .set color and .set visemail
 Added some code to start porting to Win95/NT

 8/3/97
 Removed .stalker to add .talker command which allows to add, modify, and
delete talkers. Read the helpfile.
 Added #define's TALKERLIST and NO_TLIST

   88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
   8888888888888888 Below this point are 1.1.1 changes 8888888888888888 
   88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888

 8/2/97
 Started on 1.2.0
 Added user structures help,who,friends,gagged.
 Added functions listen_all(user),ignore_all(user) to replace strcpy(user
flags,FLAGS_ON/OFF);
 Remove FLAGS_ON and FLAGS_OFF #defines.
 Remove MACRODIR,ALERTDIR,GAGDIR #defines since macro,alert, and gag
directory will no longer exist.
 Put user abbreviations on separate lines in user data file.
 Put user's alert and gagged users in data file.
 Put user's macros to user's data file, no more macro file.
 Added functions gag_check() and gag_check2(). Modified functions
alert_check(), alert(), and gag() to take in account loaded structures of
.friends and .gagged instead of files.
 Added delimiters to user's data file to signify beginning and end of
sections.
 Sent bot info commands +++++ REBOOT, +++++ SHUTDOWN, and +++++ QUIT
 Added .ignore roomdescs and 2 empty ignores for future use.
 Modified t_who() to take in account new friends structure for .friends
(mode 3)

 7/15/97
 Added bot global (int bot) to hold bot's user number for its login.
 Added bot_com and botsys[] (parallel to sys[] and exec_com) for bot
commands. bot commands will start with a _ and only send info back to the
bot set as BOT_ID. Some changes to the main loop and get_com_num() were
done to accomplish this.

 7/13/97
 Frogged users can no longer .to speech

 7/11/97
 Added check on boot-up for max connections set against file descriptors
available
 Fixed glitch in entpro and descroom that a variable wasn't clearing after
the function return;'ed
 Increased size of option variable in shutdown function from 80 to
ARR_SIZE;

 7/10/97
 Fixed bug in remove_junk() that wasn't actually removing the files.
 Added tzinfo/ directory to the distribution with all time zone info in
it. Do not rename this directory.
 Changed systime() to take tz info from tzinfo/ directory. FreeBSD, 
NetBSD, and UnixWare had incomplete or screwy zoneinfos.
 Changed Makefile so that 'make dist' copied tzinfo/ too.

 7/6/97
 Fixed glitch with pcreate
 .search's are no longer case-sensitive
 put some stuff in supass and suname
 Took out all PRIROOM stuff..i think it was a stupid iforms idea really.
 singular/plural-sensitiveD converttime() string

 6/20/97
 Compiled successfully on Digital UNIX. (a few warnings..they're no harm)
 Where it says "The room is set to...." in .look, if the area is locked
public, it will say, "The room is ^HClocked^ to..."
 Colors in .private and .public function.
 Removed year from time/date stamp in syslog entries..just takes up space.

 6/14/97
 fmail/autofwd security hole fixed.
 .shutdown -r now reboots the talker properly. No more socket errors 
plauging the log.
 NEW feauture. Rwho (remote who), gets a real-time who listing from the 
given talker. ".who @<talker keyword>"  ".w @" gives you a list. Iforms 
style and ncohafmuta talkers are supported. MOST NUTS talkers dont have 
external who ports. This command is forked so you and other players may 
talk while the talker gets the rwho listing in the background.
 Added .rules command. takes file from global RULESFILE which contents i 
made from a combination of .h etiquette and .h disclaimer
 For .look, if there are shadows in the room it will tell you (with 
global define VIS_IN_HERE), unless you are >= MIN_HIDE_LEVEL in which 
case it will give their name/desc thing with (invis) after their name.
 Cumulative time structure (totl) resets at 999 days, not 99 days

 6/12/97
 More <wiz> messages written to the wiztell buffer, SUICIDE, etc..
 If a user is ignoring pictures, they wont get ptells pics either now.
 Finished .pcreate. Read help file.
 FILETEMP is replaced by function get_temp_file() which creates a new 
tempfile with a random number os no two tempfile creations clash. These 
tempfile will be stuck in junk/ directory and removed on startup and at 
midnight with new utility function remove_junk()
 Trying to forward/autoforward mail will not even be ATTEMPTED now if the 
user has their email address as the default.

 6/10/97
 If a user .ustat's themselves and their email address is hidden, it will
show it to them now instead of just saying -hidden-
 If a user .ustat's themselves they will see what rank they are now.

 6/9/97
 Added abbrcount() function, and execute it on startup to compares counts
between the sys[] structure and NUM_ABBRS.
 .clist bans/newbans <search string> to search for banned sites instead of
having to look at the whole list.

 6/3/97
 Users that have .permission to a room can go there now EVEN IF it's not
adjoined to their current room. They can also make the room their home if
they have .permission to it.

 6/2/97
 Modified password() passwords can no longer have spaces in them. Too many
people using the syntax .password <old_pass> <new_pass> when it's just
.password <new_pass>
 Modified Makefile to add system specific -D's
 Modified code to use Makefile defined -D's
 Modified main function..did checking for non-blocking function from fcntl
Changed select() descriptors that are read to FD_SETSIZE.
 Modified make_sockets() to check for non-blocking from fcntl.
Added check to make sure machine is a host with gethostname and
gethostbyname.
 All sockets that get close()'d, now also get a shutdown(sock,2);
 Declared bzero() for make_sockets()
 Added more error cases to shutdown_error()
 
 6/1/97
 Removed check_abbrs() function. Checks are performed for all users on talker
boot in reset_userfors() instead.
 Bug fix put in abbreviations check. Talker previously did not
recognize you changing the name of a command and changing the command name in
the user .abbr's. Symptoms of this problem were user's name changing to
abbreviations, $ \ ", etc.. Also added 10 to a user's abbreviation space
allocation in the user struct {} profile, since NUM_ABBRS doesn't allow
enough room for user abbreviations to be read in intially if the global was
decreased in constants.h
 Removed incompatible pointer type errors for the utility announce.c
 Added some lib options to the Makefile for UnixWare compiles (ick!)

 5/28/97
 Users are now kicked out when they hit IDLE_TIME, instead of going 1 over
it
 LOGIN_TIMEOUT now defines how many minutes a user can be at the login
prompt before getting kicked out (WAS hardcoded to 3)
 Gagcommed users can't .smail
 Gagged users can't .to or .join the gagger
 Can't suname or supass users that are of same rank or greater rank than
you.

 5/19/97 pl6
 Changed ptell output message
 Fixed macro making so you can macro commands that start with .n except
for .nerf if it's set not to be macroed..previously it wouldn't let you
macro any .n command because it thought it was .nerf

 5/15/97
 Added shutdown_error() function to shut down the talker on an error
accepting a socket..esp. on a reboot with .shutdown -r
 Modified the external_www() function a bit to increase the chance of it
spitting out the user list correctly.
 Fixed the social function.
 Modified check_mess() function to print to the system log how many
messages are deleted at midnight and to tell the users when a system check
is completed so they don't think they lagged out. Also changed way temp
messages are written back to the message boards so it's faster.

 5/13/97
 Finished changes from "headquarters" to HEAD_ROOM
 Made kill messages global.
 You can still look at warning logs of people that dont exist anymore
 When a user is renamed their warning log is moved to the new name too.

 5/5/97
 Made some changes in .suname and .supass

   88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
   8888888888888888 Below this point are 1.1.0 changes 8888888888888888 
   88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888

 5/2/97 pl5
 Fixed bugs and glitches

 4/28/97 pl2
 Updated functions read_user(), descroom(), inedit_file(), and
inedit_file2()

 4/27/97 pl1
 Fixed abbreviation re-evaluation by adding checks to reset_userfors()
which is executed on talker startup.

 4/25/97
 The .banname check uses in-string checks now instead of exact checks.
Meaning, if you ".banname shit" any user trying to login with the word
"shit" in their name will fail. Previously if you banned that name, a user
like "shithead" could login since the name didn't match the banned 
name exactly.
 Added global LONGLOGIN_WHO. If set to 0, when a user types "who" at the
login prompt they will get a short who (.swho) If 1, they get the normal
.who

 4/23/97
 Added a line to the WWW port output to connect to the talker. Points to
the global TELNET_TO
 logged ip addresses for who and www ports connects are now resolved. This
is because if a site is totally restricted, they should not be allowed to
make www and who port connections, which is checked for now.

 4/19/97
 A .h now doesn't show the '.' before the commands in the list
 For users who used to or currently do try to do help on a command
literally (i.e. .h .succ) instead of .h succ, both ways will now work.

 4/17/97
 Added mail_warn ustr[user]. structure. Saved to user data file. This
structure is a check to see whether a user has received mail that their
mail file is over the size limit, so that they do not receive the message
each time someone tries to email them. (i.e. if someone is spam mails them
and they're over thier limit, the talker is gonna send them a message for
every mail, saying that they're over their limit, therefore spamming them
anyway) this flag is reset to 0 when the user uses .cmail successfully.

 4/16/97
 Fixed minor glitches.
 Fixed all occurences of things like "1 citizens online" or "displayed 1
users"
 Added SHORT_WHO message global.

 4/14/97
 AFK_BACK3 global shown to users who come back from being afk.

 4/13/97 
 Added .banname command to ban names from logging in or creating accounts
  Added nbanned[] list, NBANFILE, and NUM_NAMEBANS
 Added some more globals for messaging.
 For .to, now you can't .to a user that is AFK or BAFK

 4/12/97 
 Added stuff in .ranks
 Remove from constants.h *numcmds[] list and NUM_COMS global
 Put autopromote checking in command line .entpro (BUT YOU MUST INSERT 
TEXT FOR IT TO TAKE THE PROMOTION STEP), inserting blank lines doesnt count.
 Changed init_user() and add_user() to work more efficiently.
 Jazzin added 18 socials

 4/11/97
 You can now move users that are NOT online.
 Added <message> option to .kill (i.e. .kill <user> <message>)
with <message> being the global message sent on a user-kill.
 Added "all" option to .delatmos
 Changed file naming for atmosphere from "atmos<room number>" to <room 
name>.atmos (i.e. front_gate.atmos)
 Added enhanced profile editing to .descroom command.

 4/10/97
 Added some stuff in ./restart
 Changed the way MOTDs randomize..now instead of set globals for motds 
(MOTD1/motd and DTOM1/dtom1) it will be just the word motd with a number, 
starting with 0..first motd is motd0, then motd1, then motd2, and so on.
The number of motds you have should be set in the global NUM_MOTDS, in 
constants.h
 Fixed .picture bug of showing the list of filenames to everyone.
 Typing .ptell by itself now results in a file listing, not "Who do you 
want to send a picture to" or whatever.

 4/4/97
 Added init_netname structure which is the resolved site a user was 
created from. Runs with the already existing, but not-known-of, init_site
 Changed .entpro so you can edit profiles from the command line/prompt.
Lots of options in here, so READ THE HELP FILE.
 Fixed reading and writing of user data files.
 Now if you .ustat a user that is online, it reads their current 
strcuture, not their saved data file, which may not be as updated.
 Fixed bug in .examine that could crash the talker.
 Added more info in .examine, to make it look a little nicer.

 3/28/97
 In write_board() changed a line for the wiznote btell from sprintf() to
strcpy()..dunno HOW it got to sprintf. *shrug*
 Added global ANON_SUGGEST in constants.h so admins can set whether they want
.suggest suggestions to be anonymous or not.
 Added globals MOVE_TOUSER, MOVE_TOREST, and MOVE_TONEW to set messages
that are shown when a user is moved.
 Added globals ARREST_TOUSER, ARREST_TOREST, and ARREST_TOJAIL to set
messages that are shown when a user is arrested.

 3/27/97
 Added -c/clear option to .macros
 Added help glboal HELPSTYLE to let admins decide if they want..
  A) A blank help as the new style (commands by type) and ".h old" would
     be commands by level. OR
  B) A blank help as the old style (commands by level) and ".h old" would
     be commands by type.
 Added subject lines to autoforwarded and .fmail email that is sent out
from talker to user.
 .expire -n doesn't show how long ago they were on, it just nukes them now

 3/25/97
 Finished .set beeps and .set show.
 Fixed .suicide so that if a user gets demoted, they can't suicide and
come back and repromote themselves. Thanx Jazzin for pointing it out.
 Added .friends, untested as of yet. It's a new mode in t_who()

 3/23/97
 Logged adding of atmospherics to a room.
 Removed sw mode from init_user(), no need for it.
 Added resolve_names variable to init_data file first line, and removed
RESOLVE_DEFAULT global. Added dummy character to room lines in init_data
file so you know which room is which.
 Added in the .set recap function.

 3/19/97
 .expire -e won't exempt users that don't exist.
 Added globals for tells and creplys, VIS_TELLS, INVIS_TELLS,
VIS_FROMTELLS, VIS_FROMLINK.
 Added homepage and desc search options for .clist

 3/18/97
 Removed comment from checked line in check_mess();
 Removed temp user strctures: pcount, icount, acount, pmode, and pinput.

 3/17/97
 Added emote option to .mutter (.mutter <user> <your emote abbr><message>)
 Finished .time revamp. Removed globals ZONE_OFF, and all the DST globals.
Main timezones are still show, but now in am pm 0-12 hour format, not 24
hour format. a .time -l gets you a list of lesser-main zones, which you
can get time on by doing .time <zone> (i.e. .time hawaii)
 Added get_emote(user) function to get the emote abbreviation placer
for user commands that checked for a ; or : to do emotes in stuff.
Like a .wiztell ;<action>  now becomes..
.wiztell <what user has set for .emote><action>
 Changed formatting in last 3 lines of .ustat
 Removed user structures that aren't needed anymore. listen, dir, and 
tzone
 Removed .set tzone command and functions related to it. I never liked
this idea in the first place, most people just look at .time
 Added more line variables to the [Muzzled, Visible, ....] line
 Changed login message of when you were last logged in.
 Fixed nuke() for kill-nukes.

 3/15/97
 Changed MONTH_OFF to DAYS_OFF, if we expire by number of days, we don't
have to worry about the fluctuating number of days in a month, esp. Feb.
 Added EXPIRE_EXEMPT global. If this is set to a user level #, users at
and above that level get an extra 30 days before showing up on .expire -n
Setting this global to -1 disables this bonus.
 Changed show_expire() to reflect the DAYS_OFF change.
 Moved rank odds from text.h to constants.h
 Changed user data readfile and writefile macros from xwrite() and
xread() to fscanf()'s fprintf()'s and 4 macros rlong() and rtime() that
both point to a read_time()..and wlong() and wtime(). I'm planing on writing
the user data files with them instead. Easier to read, easier to change a
user's file by hand if need be, and minimizes the program's chance of reading
an improper value or corrupting the file.
 Changed user structures rawtime, numcoms, and totl to "long" declarations.

   88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
   8888888888888888 Below this point are 1.0.* changes 8888888888888888 
   88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888

 3/14/97
 Moved timed alarm() events to main function and made easier to read.
 Changed Daylight Savings Time info in constants.h (more coming later)
 Made .suname so that you can't chaneg a user's name to a name that
already exists.
 Cleaned up some small stuff, probably unnoticeable.

 3/5/97
 Added .wlog and .unarrest command. Read the help.
 Added bzero() to make_sockets()
 Added email search option to .search
 Now you can give a "kill -USR1 <pid>" from the unix command line to
give the talker a clean shutdown if you can't connect for some reason.

 3/1/97
 Patched .expire for 29/28 days in february
 Patched send_mail function checking of partial-named recepient.
 Patched storage space for get_help_file(), preview(), and picture()

 2/19/97
 Fixed bug in .fight as per smoothie. Thanx!
 Fixed password case-mixing. No biggie.
 Added a line option to .preview and .picture. Read the respective
helpfiles

 2/15/97
 Made .echo so that you can't echo usernames even if they're NOT ONLINE.
 Made a nuke do a kill on auto, since nuking a user before killing them
is useless, this takes care of it for you.

 2/11/97
 Made gag and alert so you can ungag and unalert users that don't exist
anymore.
 Made DEMOTE_SAME global to constants.h so admins can decide easily if
they want wizzes and up to be able to demote their own kind.
 Made USTAT_PROFILE global to constants.h so admins can decide easily if
they want .ustat to show a user's .ex profile

 2/7/97
 Added more options to the .cbuff command. The former "all" option is now
the "rooms" option. Read the helpfile
 Added functions cshbuff() ctellbuff()
 Set paging (one screen at a time) for .samesite, .restrict, .bannew, and
.clist
 Fixed bug in .force which tried to allows users to force offline users
certain flags which they must be online for.

 2/1/97
 Added another toggle level for .autoread and .autofwd. FOR autoread, the
toggles are now off, autoread on just login, or autoread on login and when
you get mail inside the talker. FOR autofwd, the toggles are now off,
autofwd all the time, or autofwd just when you're not online.
 Long usernames that exactly match as input string for .site now print out
their info, not like before.
 Redid socket code. Made accept sockets just one sockaddr, instead of like
6. What was once in set_up_socket() is now make_sockets().
 Updated helpfiles.

 1/29/97
 Took out arpa/inet.h include, don't need it anymore. Fixed bug that
.greet crashes the talker if you don't compile with the -traditional flag.
 Added .guru command structure. Sort of like eight-ball. I promised him I
would do it :-)
 Added afk desc-messages to who port userlist.

 1/27/97
 Stripped color before sending off an autoforward email.
 Added -h option to .rooms, to see a list of hidden rooms for users above
the ROOMVIS_LEVEL.
 Added global FOLLOWIS_JOIN for admins to turn on/off whether a .follow
for a user allows the user to telport to the target user's room. i.e. the
room doesn't have to be connected.
 Fixed log_misc_connect getting of ip addresses
 Added resolve_add() to simplify resolution of incoming addresses to
hostnames.

 1/25/97
 Fixed unnoticeable glitch in .afk and .bafk
 Added a -l option to .meter to see login activity to the talker per hour.
 At the end of every day, the info will be appended to the file pointed to
by the global, ACTVYFILE. Also will be put there on a shutdown or reboot.
actually done in write_meter();

 1/22/97
 Fixed bug in .site
 Took out suggest() function and integrated the command into read_board()
and write_board() homogenaity. (What a word) You cna now do selective
reads on the wiz, suggestion, and gripe board.
 Color codes for blinking, reverse video, and underline are now BL, RV,
and UL respectively.

 1/17/97
 Made BOTS_ROOTID so users can't echo the bot's owner's name to do
his commands.
 Made it so that you can't suname a user to a name with non-letters.
 Made the color test option, turn color on, then off after the test
because if a user had color of, which is the default, user won't see color
in the test.

 1/14/97
 Fixed bug in the successes and fails
 Fixed glitch in .log, Finished .set pbreak. If set on, who list will be
paged out to the user based on how they have their rows set.
 Fixed it so that if user is above a level 0 and has their description as
the default description, they don't get mistakenly autonuked.
 Cleaned up some things and fixed all the minor glitches with this new
version.

 1/6/97
 Fixed a few bugs in the new version. Added a mode option to
write_hilite() so you cna write colors with it. Added a color_strip()
function. Added check_for_file() function. Found out the reboot option for
.shutdown doesn't work on SunOS.

 1/3/97
 Added lots more globals to .h file. Most for defaults and for ranks.
 Made gripes not anonymous anymore.
 Fixed column write problem with write_str()
 Finished custom abbreviations for commands with .abbr  Added NUM_ABBRS
global. It EQUALS the number of abbreviations set in the sys[] command
structure.
 
 1/1/97
 Added color options to selective hilites. Read .h coloruse
 Added port type argument to .close and .open commands. Read the help.

 12/29/96
 Added -s option to .rmail so users can see how big their mailfiles are,
so they know they won't go over their disk limit.
 Added .gagcomm command and all code that goes with it. Added globals for
its messages and more globals for muzzle and xcomm messages, among others.
 Commands users cannot do when gagcommed are .tell, .semote, .creply,
.sthink, .ptell, .picture, .echo, and all socials.
 Added a btell for auto-nukes.
 Added auto_promote code. If user is level 0 and enters a description
gender and profile, they will be promoted to level 1 by the talker. If use
is demoed for some reason or promoted by a wizard before they auto-promote
themselves, user will NOT be able to auto-promote themselves again by
doing those 3 commands. It only makes sense. Added AUTO_PROMOTE global in
library file so admins can turn the feature on or off.
 Finished .frog command. Read the help on it.
 
 12/27/96
 Added in that users in a profile, room description, or vote topic, will
no longer ignore tells, but checks will go in all private comm. commands
to tell people That a person is entering a profile, vote desc. or whatever
with #define IS_ENTERING
 Made the .vote -c delete the vote topic too. So to start a vote, you do
.vote -c and then .vote -d. NOT the other way around!

 12/26/96
 You should be able to use caret hilites anywhere now. The formatting on
some things might be off since i can't remember everything that changes.
If you find something wrong, let Cygnus know.
 Finished the mail checks for auto-forwarding and mailfile size. Added
global defines MAX_AUTOFORS, MAX_MAILSIZE, MAILFILE_NOTIFY, and
MAILFILE2_NOTIFY.
 Added PROMOTE_TO_ABOVE flag to let admin control whether people with
.promote can promote ABOVE their level.
 Changed .who formatting to accomadate caret hilited descriptions.
 Changed .site so you can site someone that is offline.
 Fixed little .entpro/.vote -d/.descroom glitch
 Made .samesite so that you can search for hostnames as well as ip #s
 Made roomsec() function for .permission less screwy and more normal. A
non-permission for a room is now a 'N' not a ' '
 User listen and ignore flags are now 1's and 0's not 1's and spaces. 2
defines for total flags, FLAG_ONS, FLAG_OFFS
 Fixed glitch that .vote had on Linux.
 Added .to command for directed says.
 Added NUKE_NOSET define global to let admins tell the talker whether
new users signing off without changing their description should be nuked.

 12/20/96
 .suicide's are now logged.
 Changed .demote so that if a user is being demoted to a level that
shouldn't have .monitor privledges, it resets their monitor to off. It's
only fair.
 Fixed .gag and .alert so you can't add users that don't exist. DUH!
 Made array sizes larger to try and stop memory overwrites. Started adding
code to limit autoforwards messages per day for each user. Started
.gagcomm function/command. Next code compile will result in level changes,
data file structure increases, and a necessary user wipe.
 
12/7/96
 Added (V)iew option to .entpro prompt. Added PROFILE_PROMPT global.

12/6/96
 If you do an .examine <user>, it will give you the real status on
them, if they exist or jsut don't have a profile..before it used to say
"User doesn't exist or doesn't have a profile", but now you know which.
 Increased .expire exempt users to 15 by default.
 Added Save, Redo, or Abort? option to all the editor commands, .entpro,
.vote -d, .descroom
 Updated .samesite so you can also samesite a user as well as an ip.
 Added a reboot (-r) option with time to .shutdown
 FINALLY FIXED the .site for linux..added get_ip_address() function.
 Added color write_str and write_str_nr functions but did not implement
yet.

12/3/96
 Made .mutter so person has to be in room with you for it to work AND you
must type the name of the person IN FULL.
 Updates the read_exem_data() function to detect on bootup whether the
number of expire names in the globals file was changed. If so, it updates
the file with more or less globals.

12/2/96
 Added possesive emote options to .semote, .shemote, .wiztell,
.emote, and .creply.  Re-read the help files on these commands.

11/26/96
 Made .cbuff all  and .monitor level 4 commands now instead of 5.
 Changed the output of .muzzle just a litte.

11/23/96
 A logout now is in blue for people who see colors, so as to distinguish
from logins
 If you have someone on your .alert list, but you are ignoring
logins/outs, it still will tell you that the user has logged in AND beep.
 Added 'profdel' option to .force to let wizzes and up delete users'
profiles if they have to.
 Made more messages to globals progressively. Promotions and demotions are
now .wiztelled as per request.
 Added a new command .suicide to let a user nuke his/her own account.
Read the helpfile on it.

11/20/96
 Added a -c/clear option to .set email  for users that want to clear their
email address. (Since setting an email address requires a @ and a .)

11/6/96
 Added .shthink (shout think)
 Cleaned up some small stuff and globals
 Added BOT_ID like ROOT_ID
 Made if_cons.h now constants.h and if_text.h is now text.h
 Added stuff so that the bot can work easier on the talker. Included
the bot code in the talker distribution.

11/1/96
 Added partial helpfile matching. Like if you did ".h rea" it would say
that the pattern was not unique, matched: read readlog
but like ".h atm" would show the 'atmos' helpfile
 Made .h to list commands from the command structure, instead of having to
edit a rank helpfile everytime i add a command. also ".h old" brings up
the old way of looking at the command list. Added a few "#define"s
 The command structure was changed internally to make the .h possible and
to make checking for abbreviations and adding default abbreviations for
commands easier.
 Added my own password encryption function in case anyone doesn't like
deep's.  cyg_crypt()
 Abbreviation check for commands in get_com_num() are now done by querying
the command structure instead of it being set ni the function. Soon, users
will be able to set their own character abbreviations for commands.

10/30/96
 Added 3 commands for atmospheric control.  .addatmos to add atmospherics
to the current room you are in.  .delatmos to delete them one at a time.
.listatmos to list the current atmospheres for a room.  For Level 5
and up.  Read the help files on them for full explanation.
 Fixed the .time command/function to take in account Daylight savings for
all zones shown. Global to turn daylight savings on or off is in the lib
file. Added New Zealand and Brazil time zones.
 Modified profile, vote topic, and room description entry functions so
that user's ignore/listen flags are restored to what they were before they
entered the function. Previously, they were ignoring all, then listening
to all, which meant they had to restore their listen/ignore flags
manually.

10/26/96
 Made ranks more global so other talkers could change the NUMBER of ranks
more easily. Like from 8 to 4, or whatever.
 Made ".cbuff all" a level 5 command option.
 Made .entpro show you at the beginning how many lines you can write.

10/25/96
 Made a lot of messages in the talker globals in the if_cons.h library
file so that it's easier for others to chaneg the code for a new talker.
Hopefully gonna get all of them as globals, but there are so damn many of
them. :)
 Changed .bannew and .restrict yet again. Keep getting requests on them.
You know who you are. There is now a -c and -r option. The -c option lets
you write a long comment about the site (why it is banned..who caused the
banned..your name if you want to show you banned it..how long it SHOULD be
banned). The -r option again lets you give a reason why it is banned. This
is different in that THIS is the message shown to people who try and log
in from said 'site'. The max length is set as REASON_LEN in if_cons.h,
currently 320 characters (4 lines). On the list of banned sites, now along
with the site name/ip and how long ago it was banned, it shows comments too.
The commands' helpfile tells you most of this and some more.

10/13/96
 Made .atmos command now .atmos [all|<room_name>] if all, it will toggle
whether atmospherics are on or off for all rooms like normal. If a room
name is specified, the atmospheres for that room will be toggled on or
off. In the init_data file, the room line info has another flag for
initial atmospheres (right after the hidden flag) if 0, the room initially
has them turned off, if 1, on.
 Example..    town_square AGDB 0 1
The room's atmospheric status will also now show up in the .rooms command,
next to the private/public area_change flag. If the atmos are on for the
room, it will show an "A", if not, nothing will be shown.
 Bans now have time/date stamping. A blank .bannew or .restrict will show
the sites/clusters/domains banned and how long ago it was banned.
 You can now specify a reason to be shown to all who log in from a banned
or new-banned site, by specifying a message after the sitename for the
restrict or bannew command.
 Example.. .restrict microserve.com You're site is banned from this talker
           because of excessive player making.
The SYS_NOT_ALLOWED and NO_NEW_MESS globals were replaced with BANNED_MESS
and BANNED_NEW_MESS to be the initial messages shown to users that are
banned if a banner does not specify a reason on the command line.
 Made a little auto_restrict() function to simplify the auto restricting
of a site by the talker.
 Fixed bug in read_board() for reading # of messages.
 Put "all" option for .cbuff to clear all room buffers.
 Connections to the WHO port are now logged.
added .smiles social
put one or two lines in version()
in t_who() put PROF in "Idle" field if user is entering profile
in t_who() put users' afkmsg as their desc., if they are afk and have one
therefore, made afkmsg length to DESC_LEN
in lock_afk check in main while() loop, put a telnet_echo_off for users
that are bafk locked so when they enter their password, it won't be shown
can't put in the normal afk lock, because a telnet_echo_off() would then
supress all info to the user, just like a bafk
WORKING on the paged who list..added 5 structures to use with it.
 * pcount - to hold the "u" variable (user num) when the function breaks
            out to get confirmation
 * acount - to hold the "v" variable (area num) when the function breaks
            out to get confirmation
 * icount - to hold the "invis" variable (invisible users already in
            counter) when the function breaks out to get confirmation
 * pmode  - to hold the "mode" variable (who mode) when the function
            breaks out to get confirmation
 * pinput - to hold the "inpstr" variable (user search string, if any)
            when the function breaks out to get confirmation
In .ustat took out the User Status line with the two "---" lines before
and just put one line with "User is logged in" in between the "---"'s if
the specified user is logged in. Saves two lines of junk.
Changed autofwd to also forward 3 lines which say that if you would like
to respond to this sender, try emailing them at their email address, and
it writes ustr[user].email_addr in there. However, if the user's email is
hidden, it just shows the normal external mail message. See EXT_MAILx in
if_cons.h
 Made it so that invisible people can't participate in nerfs..All users
must be visible.
 Made it so that people in remote rooms can't read hidden boards
 Changed the end of read_mail to handle number inpstrs better and to
decrease new mail messages instead of just set to 0 when only some new
ones are read. Also fixed so that if a user enters a number > the number
of messages in their mailfile, it WILL cat out the whole file instead of
showing them nada.
 Changed .ustat's function to say (if the user has new mail) "Has %d new
mail messages." instead of "Has unread mail messages."
 Made .vote -d so you can change the vote topic internally. which included
non-saved user structures vote_enter, vote_start, vote_end. And functions
enter_votedesc() and write_vote()
 Now users of same level as promote or demote victim, can't promote or
demote the victim.
 Made AFK_NERF global to prevent people from going afk or bafk in the
nerf_room (if set to 0 in the lib file)
 Updated creply() to take in account gagged users, afks, igtell, and if
the phoned user logs off.
 Made time function so ZONE_OFF global can be negative (i.e. time zones to
the right of EST, UK, Europe, etc..)
 Made the .memory command for level 3 and above to check mem stats on all
major structures and buffers.

 
# Version 1.0.23 #

  show color, no more wlist() (Reason: too hard to change the list..have
  to reboot every time you promote a wiz/user)
* Character mode clients should be supported now.
* Passwords are not echoed back to users anymore.
* Made a global #define for selective hilites, since they don't work on
  linux.

  room you CAN'T fight in..also users now must be in the same room as one
  another to fight.
* Removed TIME_ZONE and TIME_MESSAGE (?) global defines.
* Updated help files.

         Cygnus    from  205.164.146.11
         Cray      from  145.205.3.4
          *NOTE: Since it has to check EVERY user file, it causes lag and

Added .log command.

# Version 1.0.18#
Removed: .afklog, .cafklog (too much mem usage) and not needed
         .punt (can just move them) groups commands (stupid idea

         .vsugg (can just use a blank .suggest)
Changed: .go (normal users can now warp to main room with blank command,
         except for room "jail"..hehe, almost forgot about that)
         swho(lined up columns...again, forgot about a minor thing)
         idle times (users time out after 300 minutes, made so that

         Sites still stuff up..I'm pissed. :)

# Version 1.0.17#
Sites still not fixed *sigh* I just don't know.
Added: .bubble, random color in .look exits, more color in .who, (afk) string
       after user desc. in .look to show being afk. .stalker searches the 
       talker address list for the talker you specify. Changed say and
       tell format to use quotes. Needed for story bot.
Changed: swho(lined up columns), optional messages for .afk(.afk <mess>), 
         changed .echo so users cannot echo login/outs. 

# Version 1.0.15#

Fixed incompatible pointer type in gethostbyaddr, integer variable 
changed to (char *). Maybe that'll fix the sites?? Added .quote to allow 
users to turn the quotes feature off at login time. Added level 4's to
the .wizards list. 

# Version 1.0.14#

Added .cafklog and .afklog. They work, but up the mem usage 2%! Go figure.
Added additional help and quit pointers. ('HELP','QUIT')

# Version 1.0.13#

Tried to fix stuffing of sites with new function addrout(long a);
Added clears for .succ and .fail.  Added .visemail for hidden email
address. Add pointers to .help and .quit for says of 'help' '/help'
'/quit' 'quit', etc..
