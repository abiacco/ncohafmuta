
 This is the main config file for the talker.
 These settings can be reloaded with .admin <config name> load <type>
 i.e. .admin config load strings or .admin config load globals

char config[num].name
int config[num].type
void config[num].value

Rules:
Lines with # in front are ignored
Lines with spaces in front are ignored unless part of a description
Strings are marked with a " aa the first character in their value.
Ints are marked as values without a " as the first character

Implementation:
Config file will be read in sections (<type>) which can be reloaded
on the fly. Each section marker is surrounded in ..'s
the strings section starts with
..Strings..
and ends with
..End Strings..
