Applet created by <A HREF="http://www.joot.com">Dave Jarvis</A>
<HR>

<!-- This configures and launches the Terminal Emulator
     The 5's must be at least 5.  There is a glitch in some browsers that
     causes them to crash if the applet's width and height are smaller than
     5 pixels. -->
<APPLET CODEBASE="http://%host%:%webport%/connect" CODE="Telnet.class" WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=5>

  <!-- When running the Terminal Emulator as an applet, and without
       using the Proxy Server software, the value of the host you
       place here must be the same as the server name shown in the
       URL to download the applet.  That is, if the URL for this
       page was "http://%host%/~palace", then you would
       set the HOST value to "%host".
       
       If you are using this software as an application, then the
       contents of this file will be ignored. -->
  <PARAM NAME="HOST" VALUE="%host%">
  <PARAM NAME="PORT" VALUE="%mainport%">

  <!-- If you have the Proxy Server installed on the same machine as
       the Web server, change these two lines to the same configuration
       as the Proxy Server.  By using the Proxy Server, you are then
       free to change the above two lines (HOST and PORT) to any server
       and any port on the Internet.

       Once again, if you do not have the Proxy Server installed, the
       only place the Terminal Emulator may connect to is the Web Server
       that hosts the Terminal Emulator itself. -->
  <PARAM NAME="PROXYHOST" VALUE="your.web.server.com">
  <PARAM NAME="PROXYPORT" VALUE="10000">

  <!-- DEFAULT APPLET CONFIGURATION OPTIONS -->

  <!-- Does the user type in the main screen, or in a special place
       that doesn't interfere with the text displayed on the screen?
       This option is best left ON for chat systems, but OFF if used
       for shell access. -->
  <PARAM NAME="TypingBar" VALUE="on">

  <!-- What font size should the applet come up in? -->
  <PARAM NAME="FontSize" VALUE="12">

         Dark Magenta, Dark Cyan, Dark Gray, and Dark Grey.
         
       Caveat: The spelling of Colour in all the PARAM tags is British.
       "CursorColor" would be ignored, for example.  Don't change the
       spelling, and no problems will ensue. -->

  <!-- Different types of cursor shapes:
         block       a cursor filling up an entire character width
         underscore  a cursor that sits below the characters
         hollow      a block cursor that isn't filled
         vbar        a vertical line

         This option is currently ignored (only block cursor). -->

  <!-- What's the default cursor colour? -->
  <PARAM NAME="CursorColour" VALUE="cyan">

  <!-- Colour of the applet's background.  If you change the background
       colour of this page (BODY BGCOLOR tag), you may wish to change

  <!-- Some systems know the user has pressed Enter when they get a
       carriage return followed by a line feed.  If things don't
       happen when you press enter, change the "on" to "off", and
       the emulator will send a CR/LF pair when enter is pressed,
       instead of just sending a line feed. -->
  <PARAM NAME="EnterSendsCRLF" VALUE="on">

  <!-- Some systems send out a line feed to drop the cursor to the next
       line, but don't send a carriage return to tell the cursor to
       move to the beginning of the next line!
                                                This causes the screen
       to look very jagged, and difficult to read.
                                                    For example, the
       screen may have text that appears like this.
                                                    If this happening,
       then try setting this option to "on".
                                              Or else people will
       complain they can't read a thing!  -->
  <PARAM NAME="LFtoCRLF" VALUE="off">

  <!-- If set to "off", the screen will flash white instead of making
       a sound.  If set to "on", the program will attempt to make the
       computer beep. -->

  <!-- Does the window get closed when the user disconnects from the
       site?  If set to "on", the window will close.  If set to "off",
