1. Intro

This README was authored by Dave Jarvis and modified by me (Anthony J. 
Biacco) for specific use of Dave's emulator under my Ncohafmuta talker
code's web port.
Any questions about configuring the emulator under the webport can go to me,
at ncohafmtua@asteroid-b612.org
Any question about the emulator itself can go to Dave, at dave@joot.com


2. Set-up

* Correct File Placement

    The files as they are, are already set up for use under Ncohafmuta's
    webport. No modifications are necessary to index.html unless you want
    to change applet options (font size, typing bar on/off)

    If running the emulator outside the webport, i.e. in a public web-server
    directory, make sure you put all the files here in a directory that
    is visible from the World Wide Web (WWW).  Typically, you'll use
    a directory called "public_html", ".www", "web", or some such
    name from your main home directory. Verify with your system administrator.


3. Configuring for Talkers

   If using under Ncohafmuta's webport:
    The host and port values are already configured (replaced by the talker 
    automatically).
    Things you MIGHT want to change are some of the applet options in the HTML
    file, typing bar on/off, font size, colors. This is OPTIONAL.

   If running the emulator outside the webport:
    There are two lines you may want to change in the "index.html" file:

    <PARAM NAME="HOST" VALUE="yourtalker.com">
    <PARAM NAME="PORT" VALUE="5000">

    These two lines are used by the Terminal Emulator to tell it where
    to connect.  The first, "yourtalker.com", is must be the name of the
    server on which your talker is running.  The second, "5000", is the
    port number your talker is running on.  You must change the first,
    and may need to change the second as well.


4. Using

* From Ncohafmuta's webport

    Direct your users to http://www.yourtalker.com:yourwebport/connect
    So, for example, if you talker was hosted on talker.com and the webport
    for your talker was 1930, you would tell your users to connect at:
      http://talker.com:1930/connect

* As an applet in your public WWW directory

    The Terminal Emulator may be used from the World Wide Web as described
    above.  When a user connects up to the web page, the Terminal Emulator
    will download off the page and automatically connect up to the server
    as defined by the lines:

    <PARAM NAME="HOST" VALUE="yourtalker.com">
    <PARAM NAME="PORT" VALUE="5000">

* As an application

    The Terminal Emulator may also be used on a computer that has a Java
    Virtual Machine on it.  It is used in exactly the same way as a regular
    telnet client.  The difference is that you must specify the name of the
    Java Virtual Machine executable as well.

    For example:
      java Telnet myserver.com
  
    Without any parameters, it defaults to connecting to the local machine's
    shell.


5. Addendum

    Please make sure you read the files COPYRIGHT and LICENSE.

    Thank you for using the Terminal Emulator!
