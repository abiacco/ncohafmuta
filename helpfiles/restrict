          To ban w/comment :  .restrict <ip_address> -c <message>
          To ban w/reason  :  .restrict <ip_address> -r <message>
          To list sites    :  .restrict
          To unban:        :  .unrestrict <ip-address>

Results:  Restrict turns off access to the talker for users at an entire 
          site. <ip-address> is the address that is to be denied access.
          This can be in the number format OR the hostname format  (below)
          If you don't specify an address, you will get a list of 
          all the restricted sites, how long ago they were banned,
          the reason shown to users that TRY to login from there, and
          the comments for wizzes why the site is banned.
          <message> is REQUIRED if -c or -r option is given, and if the
          site is already banned, the site will not be rebanned, just the
          comment/reason added.
          If no option is given, the default reason and comment is used.

          This command creates a possible 3 files in the RESTRICT_DIR
          directory. <ip_address>, <ip_address>.c, <ip_address>.r
          During login access, if a person is attempting to log in
          from a site that has a file in the restrict directory, they
          will not be allowed access.

          <ip-address> can have one of four numeric forms..
                a.b.c.d  - Specific IP 
                a.b.c    - Cluster
                a.b      - Sub-network
                a        - Network
          and four alpha-numeric forms..
                misty.com   would ban all hosts from that domain
