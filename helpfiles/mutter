 Syntax:  .mutter <user> <text>         .mutter <user> ;<action>
          # <user> <text>               # <user> ;<action>
          
Results:  This command is just like normally talking, but the text goes to
          everyone in the room BUT <user>. <user> MUST be in the room.
            The ; key is the default key for making the mutter
          with <action> a mutter-emote. If you changed your .emote key with
          .abbrs, then THAT key will replace the ; instead. The same
          applies to the # shortcut key.

Example:  #cygnus You know, I think this cygnus is a goof!
        (Will output: <your name> mutters: "I think this cygnus is a goof!" 
                      (to everyone but cygnus) )
