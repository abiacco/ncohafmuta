                      The "General Concepts" Tutorial

GOAL
 There is no object to the game other than to wander around and socially
 interact with other users.
 Titles and memberships can be picked up along the way, as your
 skills and knowledge increase.
 There are no winners or losers, only fellow users. Enjoy!

RL
 RL is short for "Real Life" - that area of the user's life outside
 of the talker. (IRL is also used, meaning In Real Life).

VR
 VR is short for "virtual reality" - that area of the user's life inside
 of the talker. The fact that the talker has no physical geography does 
 not, of course, make it any less "real" to the user.

SPAM
 Spam is not a command; rather it is the word used to describe the
 situation when text is rolling up on your screen faster than you 
 can read (or comprehend) it.  Spam can be controlled with the use
 of the /more command when using the client tinyfugue.
 It should be noted that "spam" refers to _useless_ information.
 If one goes idle in a room in the middle of a conversation,
 one ought to expect to come back to screens-full of text.  This
 is NOT "spam" -- and it is the user's own fault!

LAG
 The concept by which a user incurs a delay between when they have typed
 text or a command and when they actually see it (or the results).

IDLEING
 The concept of being logged in but not saying, doing, or interacting with
 people or the talker for a specified period of time

AFK
 AFK is short for "Away From Keyboard". A user setting themself AFK means
 they are not at their computer keyboard and are off doing some RL thing,
 for an undetermined period of time. Bathroom, making food, out to movie,
 sex, etc..

CYBERSEX
 (also known as NETSEX, CYBERRING, TINYSEX, and various other names)
 This definition was the result of a conversation between Jopsy, Druid, 
 and Bedouin, and dates from 3/18/91:  Jopsy says "Okay, in my humble 
 opinion, TinySex is that act in which one or more players engage in a
 ~conversation~ of sorts, where, by using descriptive phrases, their
 tinybodies seem to engage in an act which mirrors sex in reallife,
 for the implicitly agreed upon purpose of sexual s(t)imulation
 or gratification."
