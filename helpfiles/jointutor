                       The "Getting Started" Tutorial

As mentioned in the "Introduction" tutorial, all commands start with a 
period (.)
This tutorial, if it exists will instruct you on how to initially set up
your user for residency, so that you can access the normal user's set of 
commands and features.
The <>'s represent a variable, do not type these literally.
To get advanced help on a command, type ".h <command>" For example, ".h desc"

3 things/commands must be done by you to set up your user to the next level:

1. Set a very short description for your user (<40 chars)
   To do this, type ".desc <your description>"
   So if your username was Joe and you wanted to make your description say
   "versus the volcano" (i.e. your name listing would show up as
   "Joe versus the volcano") you would do ".desc versus the volcano"

2. Set a gender for yourself. This can be anything. Male/Female/
   Guy/Girlbot
   To do this, type ".set gender <your gender>"

3. Create a text profile. This can be you describing yourself in more detail,
   a poem, whatever.
   To do this, type ".entpro"
   This will put you in a small line-by-line editor.
   Type in line-by-line your profile (hitting ENTER after each line)
   When you are done, on a BLANK LINE, type ".s"

After you do these 3 things, you will have residency and have access to
the commands and features of a normal user.

You should now read "The Basics" tutorial by typing ".h basictutor"
