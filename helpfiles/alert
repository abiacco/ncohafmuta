 Syntax:  .alert    or   .alert <user>

Results:  When <user> is on your alert list, when they log in, you 
          will hear an audible beep to let you know they are 
          online.
          If you don't specify a user, it will show a list of people
          you are currently being alerted of.
          To take someone off your list, type .alert <user>    It's a toggle.
          Ask the admin to find out how many people you can have on
          your list.
