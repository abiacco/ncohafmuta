 Syntax:  .cmail <parameter>

 Result:  Clears messages from your mail file.  This command will work
          from any room on the system.
          .cmail <number> <number> where both numbers are the same is a line 
          delete. No line checking is done to verify how big your mail 
          file is, so if you are in doubt, check your mail file with 
          .rmail first. 

   Note:  You will be asked if you are sure you want to clear your
          mail file before it is erased, so don't panic if you type
          this command by mistake.

Example:
   To clear all messages from your file, type           : .cmail all
   To clear the first line type                         : .cmail 
   To clear line 10 from your mail, type                : .cmail 10
   To clear all lines from the beginning to line 5, type: .cmail to 5
   To clear all lines from line 8 to the end, type      : .cmail from 8
   To clear all lines from line 8 to line 10, type      : .cmail from 8 to 10
   To clear all lines except line 4, type               : .cmail except 4     
   To clear all lines except line 4 through 9, type     : .cmail except 4 to 9
