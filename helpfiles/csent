 Syntax:  .csent <parameter>

Results:  Clears messages from your SENT mail file.  This command will work
          from any room on the system.
          .csent <number> <number> where both numbers are the same is a line 
          delete. No line checking is done to verify how big your mail 
          file is, so if you are in doubt, check your sent mail file with 
          .rsent first. 

   Note:  You will be asked if you are sure you want to clear your sent
          mail file before it is erased, so don't panic if you type
          this command by mistake.

   To clear line 10 from your mail, type                : .csent 10
