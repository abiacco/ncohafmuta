 Syntax:  .samesite <IP search string/hostname>
          .samesite <user>

Results:  Allows high level users to see who came from a certain site,
          based on the last site they came from. Will also show how
          long ago they were last online.
          The search string can be full ip addresses or partial ones.
          When you search by <user> it searches for the exact match to
          <user>'s last site.

Example:  .samesite 205.164

             might show..  Cygnus    from  205.164.146.11 <last time on>
                           Gardener  from  205.164.128.11 <last time on>

  Notes:  Use this command sparcely since it causes additional lag from
          having to look through every user file in the database.
