 Syntax:  .set localecho

Results:  This command allows you to set whether or not the talker will 
	  echo back to you the text that you type. Use this if you can't 
          see whay you're typing and you don't know how to turn on localecho 
          in your client.
	  If you're seeing the input you type twice, then you have localecho 
          on in your client AND in the talker. Turn it off in either place.
          This command is a TOGGLE. Meaning, every time you type it, it
          will either turn the option on or off.
