 Syntax:  .wiztell <message>    .wiztell ;<action>   .wiztell '<action>
          > <message>           >; <action>          >' <action>

Results:  Sends a message to all the wizards currently on the board.  These
          messages will be seen only by the wizzes, so this command is
          useful when discussing private matters.  <message> is the text you
          wish to send to the other wizards.
            The ; key is the default key for making the wiztell
          with <action> a wiz emote. If you changed your .emote key with 
          .abbrs, then THAT key will replace the ; instead. The same 
          applies to the > shortcut key.
            If a ' is specified before the <action> it becomes a 
          posessive wiz emote. If you do not specify a message, you will 
          be shown a list of the most recent wiztells that were 
          performed. (a review)

Example:  To tell all the wizzes that Cygnus sucks, type:
            .wizt Cygnus sucks!   or   >Cygnus sucks!
          We all know this won't happen..but hypothetically.
