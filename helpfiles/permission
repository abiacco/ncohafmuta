 Syntax:  .permission <user> <add|sub> <room>

Results:  Gives permission or takes it away for a user to enter the
          room you specify as <room>.
          Used to add or delete permission from secured rooms for <user>.
          Permissions from lowest to highest go:
          "X" no access to room
          "N" normal access to room
          "Y" special access to room
	  "add"ing and "sub"ing goes one level at a time. If a user
          currently has "X" access and you "add" them, then they get "N"
          access. To get "Y" access, you have to "add" again. And
          vice-versa.
          If you log out of a secure room, you will return to the main room
          upon re-entering the talker unless you have .permission for that 
          room. This applies to users and wizes.
          To see just the permission list for the user, just type the command
          and the user's name

 Example:  To give frey access to the gazebo: .permission frey add gazebo
