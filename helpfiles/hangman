 Syntax:  .hangman <start|stop|status>

Results:  This will allow you to start or stop a game of hangman, 
	  and also to see the status of your current game.  If you
	  use the 'start' option, then a new game of hangman will 
	  be started (if you are not currently in a game) with a 
	  random word.  Use the ".guess" command to guess a letter 
	  in the word or to take a guess at the whole word.
