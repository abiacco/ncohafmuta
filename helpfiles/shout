 Syntax:  .shout <message>  or  ! <message>

Results:  Displays what you shout in all the rooms on the board.
          <message> is the line you want displayed. Users can ignore
          shouts if they wish. ! is a shortcut key.
          To do a shout review type .shout by itself

  Notes:  Please refrain from overusing this command.  Keep in
          mind the fact that shouts are displayed to all users,
          even those in private rooms, so please try not to swamp
          them with needless shouting.  (Thank you!)
