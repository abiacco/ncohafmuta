 Syntax:  When you want to start/fire at a user  :  .nerf <user>
          To see nerf stats for you or another   :  .ustat [<user>]

Results:  The nerf command allows two users to fight until one user is
          nerfed to death. This is done by hitting the other user so many
          times, that their energy hits 0. Whoever gets to 0 first, gets
          kicked off. You can come right back. Each user starts with an
          energy of 10 and 5 nerf shots. When your nerf-gun is empty,
          type ".reload" and your gun will reload with 5 shots. You CANNOT
          reload before you use all 5 shots. Rank has no affect with any
          user. You gotta be fast. Cheating, (macros or otherwise) WILL
          NOT be tolerated. The users must be visible and in the set
          nerf_room.
