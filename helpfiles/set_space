 Syntax:  .set space <setting>

Results:  This command allows you to set whether or not leading spaces
          that you type in are removed and discarded, or left in as text
          to show to others.
          This command is a TOGGLE. Meaning, every time you type it, it
          will either turn the option on or off.

Example:  If you have this set ON and typed in "     test"  (without
          the "'s), it might say:
           Cygnus says "test"
          If you have this set OFF, it might say:
           Cygnus says "     test"
