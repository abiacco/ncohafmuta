 Syntax:  .quota  or  .quota <num_of_new_users>

Results:  This command allows you to control how many new users
          a day you will allow on the system.  When you run it
          it will reset the counter for the day and allow <number_of
          new_users> on.  If used without a number, it will reset to
          the number specified as the default in the code. Usually 50.
          The counter is automatically reset at midnight to allow 
          <number_of_new_users> on the next day.

Example:  To increase the new user quota to 100, type: .quota 100
