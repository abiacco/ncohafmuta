 Syntax:  .move <user> <room_name>

Results:  Moves a user from one room to another.  <user> is the person you
          want to move, and <room_name> is the room you want to move the 
          user to. You can only move users of the same level or lower
          than you. Wizards cannot move users to private rooms.
          If the room is not specified, it will default to the main room.

   Note:  YOU CAN MOVE USERS THAT ARE NOT ONLINE.
