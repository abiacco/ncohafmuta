 Syntax:  .bring <user>
	  .bring <user,user,user>
	  .bring -f

 Result:  Brings one or more users on the talker to the room that you are in, 
          where <user> is that person or <user,user,user> are the people.
          Works like .move, only the person is automatically brought to the
          room you are in.
	  If you use the -f syntax above, all your friends on your .alert list
          will be brought into your current room. 
          Oh, and user must be of same rank or lower, Artemis! :-)

  NOTES:  Spaces can be placed in between user combinations w/commas.
          i.e. .bring cygnus, rager
               .bring cygnus , rager
          You can bring as many as MAX_MULTIS simultaneous people
          Default is 10
