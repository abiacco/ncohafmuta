                      The "How To Use Mail" Tutorial

The talker's internal mail system is fairly easy to use.
You have 2 mailboxes, your Inbox and your Sent-mail box. Every email you 
send out to a user gets put in your Sent-mail box.
You can mail users who are online OR offline, although mailing an online
user is most of the times kind of pointless, since you can just .tell them.
When you send a user a mail message, if they are online, they will get a 
notice saying they have new mail, and vice-versa if someone sends you mail.
If they are offline, the next time they come online they will get a notice 
that they have X new mail messages.

To read talker mail in your Inbox:
       .rmail

To read talker mail in your Sent-mail box:
       .rsent

To delete/clear mail from your Inbox:
       .cmail

To delete/clear mail from your Sent-mail box:
       .csent

NOTE: The above commands will take a variety of parameters for reading
/deleting only portions or certain lines in your mailboxes. You should read
the help on each command to learn about these options.

To send talker mail to someone:
       .smail <user> <message>

To forward/send your whole Inbox to an email address:
       .fmail <email address>

If the talker knows your email address, i.e. you set it with the .set 
commands (See "How To Change Settings/Info" tutorial), you can have it
send your new talker mail messages to your email address.
So if Joe sends you a mail message on the talker you will receive it in your
internet email box. 

An indirect command controls this setting, ".set autofwd"
By typing it, it toggles the above feature between "autofwd when you're 
offline", meaning it will only send the message to your email addy if you're
NOT on the talker, "autofwd all the time", meaning it will send the message
to your email addy no matter if you're on the talker or not, and "off" which
disables the feature.
This feature is off by default.

As previously mentioned, when you get new mail on the talker, the talker will
tell you so. Using another setting, ".set autoread", you can have the
mail message shown to you right when it's sent (or right when you login)..
this saves you from having to type .rmail to read it.
".set autoread" is also a toggle, and will toggle the feature between "on"
and "off" each time you type it.
This feature is off by default.

You should now read the "How To Get Information" tutorial by typing 
".h infotutor"
