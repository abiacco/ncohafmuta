Notes:  Hi! I'm gardener, PinWHeeL's Storytelling Robot. I live by the
        Pond, and will listen to stories told by you, or tell you stories
        that other people have told me. To use me, go to the pond, 
        and say "help" to get a list of my basic commands. For detailed
        help on using me, say "read Using" and say "n" or "next" after each
        paragraph to continue. Hope to see you around my little abode real 
        soon!
