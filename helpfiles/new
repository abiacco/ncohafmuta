-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you're new here, here is a quick run-down of what you should
know how to do.  It is suggested that you read the TUTORIAL and HELP files 
and look at all the information regarding the commands available to you. 
However many people are impatient and ignore them.  That's your choice, 
however it usually ends up where some start asking others what this or that 
command does.  In some cases that is the quickest way to get flamed.  
The people here should be above such immaturity, however it would be 
greatly encouraged and appreciated if you learn how use this talker and 
it's functions on your own.

To read the tutorial, type:  .h tutorial
To read the FAQ, type:       .faq
To read the rules, type:     .rules

If you need any help that you CAN'T find in those files,
type: .sos HELP ME!
And if a staff member is on, they will help
