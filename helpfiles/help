 Syntax:  .help [<topic>]

Results:  This command returns info about the specified command or topic. Commands can
	  be specified with or without the leading period (.)
	  Both commands and topics can be specified down to their own uniqueness.
	  Multiple matches will be displayed, if a unique match cannot be found.
	  For example to get help on the .alert command, you could type:
		.h .alert
		.h alert
		.h ale

	  Command syntaxes listed in helpfiles can be tricky. Variables that 
	  are passed to commands (strings, numbers, etc) are usually
	  enclosed in <>'s. You DO NOT type the <> when you enter the 
	  input, just the input itself. Optional variables to the command 
	  are enclosed in []'s  This means those options or variables may 
	  be ommited from the command, and are usually usually for 
	  additional features or functionality.
	  Options or variables seperated by the pipe sign (|) mean you 
	  may specify either/or. The pipe sign basically means "OR".

Example:  For the .shutdown command there is a syntax of:
	  [-r|-h] [<num_of_minutes>]
	  This means:
	  1) Both the -r and -h options are optional. The number of 
	     minutes is also optional.
	  2) Of the optional options -r and -h, either may be specified, 
	     NOT both
	  3) If you specify the num_of_minutes, you pass it like 300, not 
	     <300>
