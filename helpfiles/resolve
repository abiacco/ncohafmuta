 Syntax:  .resolve [-c|clearcache|-l|listcache]

Results:  By itself toggles how ip->hostname resolution is done in the talker.
          The config file determines the default method for when the talker 
          boots. Toggling on or off of the clipon option will start/kill the 
          clipon immediately.
          If the -c or clearcache argument is given, the DNS cache will be
          cleared (if you use the caching function)
          If the -l or listcache argument is given, the entries in the DNS 
          cache will be shown to you. If will also show you the current TTL for
          each entry, and will display an * if the entry's TTL is expired 
          (meaning re-resolution will be done when a connection comes in from
          this ip)
