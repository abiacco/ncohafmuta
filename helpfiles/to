 Syntax:  .to <user> <message>
	  .to <user> ;[']<action>
          $ <user> <message>
	  $ <user> ;[']<action>

Results:  This command is just like normally talking, but the text is 
          directed to <user>. <user> MUST be in the room. It's still
          a public message remember.
	  The second syntaxes is to send a directed emote or possesive
	  emote (with '). 
          Command can be shortened with '$' or whatever you set with .abbrs
          You cannot .to a user that is AFK or BAFK.

         Gives.. <your name> says (to cygnus) "Did you go out for dinner?"
	  $cygnus ;jumps on you
         Gives.. <your name> jumps on you (to cygnus)
