 Syntax:  .smail <user> <message>
          .smail <user,user,user> <message>
	  .smail <level #>|from <level #>|to <level #> <message>
          .smail -f <message>
	  .smail -a <message>

Results:  Sends a private mail to any user on the board. <user> is the
          person you wish to send the mail to, <message> is that note.  
	  To send a level-based mail, use the 2nd example above, with
	  the level # as the argument.
	  To send to multiple levels, use the "from" and "to" keywords.
          To send mail to all your friends on your .alert list, use
	  the -f syntax above.
	  To send a mail to EVERYONE, use the -a syntax. (This is
	  equivalent to using "to <your MAX_LEVEL>")
	  If user(s) is logged on at the time you send the mail he/she
	  will be notified immediately.  If not, then the user will be
	  notified the next time that he/she logs on or through email if
	  they have auto-forward on.
	  A <user> specified must be typed in full.
	  This command will work in any room on the board. 
	  Message will also be saved to your sent mail box, for further 
	  reference by you (providing the message reached at least 1 
	  recipient successfully)
