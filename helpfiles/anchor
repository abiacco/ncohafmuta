 Syntax:  .anchor
          .anchor <user> [<time>]

Results:  This command is used to restrict a user's movement. When
          a user is anchored they cannot use .go and are stuck in
          the room they have been .anchor'd in.
          If you only type .anchor <user> they will be anchored in that
          room until the anchor is removed. (using the same command, it's
          a toggle)
          If you use .anchor <user> followed by a number they will be
          anchored for that amount of login time.
          For example, .anchor kyla 5  will result in Kyla being unable
          to leave the room she's in for 5 minutes of login time,
          regardless of relogs. Once the time period has expired the
          user is released automatically and free to move around.
