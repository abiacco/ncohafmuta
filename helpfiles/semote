 Syntax:  .semote <user> [']<action>         /<user> [']<action>
	  .semote <user,user,user>	     /<user,user,user> [']<action>
	  .semote -f [']<action>	     /-f [']<action>

Results:  Allows you to emote one or more users something without anyone
	  else being able to see it.  <user> is the person you want to
	  action to.
          <action> is the action you want to do towards him/her/them.
          If you use the -f syntax above, <action> will be sent to all   
          your friends on your .alert list. Works the same as .femote
          This command also allows you to review your semotes if you do not
          specify anything after the .semote command. If you specify a '
          before the action, it will become posessive.
          If you do NOT specify an action, it will send to the user(s)..
          "You sense that <your name> is looking for you in <your_room>"
          while still applying to vis/invis conditions.

Example:  To hug 'cygnus' privately: .semote cygnus hugs you  or  
                                     /cygnus hugs you         or
                                     /cyg hugs you
          To hug 'cygnus' and 'rager' privately:
                                     .semote cygnus,rager hugs you  or  
                                     /cygnus,rager hugs you         or
                                     /cyg,rag hugs you
          To review your semotes: .semote

  NOTES:  Spaces can be placed in between user combinations w/commas.
          i.e. .semote cygnus, rager hugs you
               .semote cygnus , rager hugs you
	  You can semote to as many as MAX_MULTIS simultaneous people
	  Default is 10
