 Syntax:  .nuke <user>

Results:  Wipes a user from the talker. Deleted files will be the user's data
          file, mail file, and profile. Useful if you wish to .restrict a site to new
          users and want that alias to be restricted.
          If <user> is online, they will be killed first by .nuke.
