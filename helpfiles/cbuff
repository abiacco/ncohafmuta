 Syntax:  .cbuff [tells]
          .cbuff [rooms | shouts | wiz | all]   (usually just for wizzes)
  
Results:  Clears the room's conversation buffer.  In other words, when
          the .review command is used after the .cbuff command, nothing
          is displayed. 
           The "tells" option lets a user clear their own tell buffer.
           The "all" option is given to clear shout, wiztell, and room
          buffers.
           The "rooms" option clears the conversation buffer in all the
          rooms.
           The "wiz" option clears the wiztell buffer.
           The "shouts" option clears the talker's shout buffer.

   Note:  If two users are in a room and one leaves..cbuff is done
          automatically. For privacy reasons. Also applys in some other
          cases.
