 Syntax:  .set abbrs

Results:  This command allows you to set whether your abbreviations (set
          under .abbrs) will work with the commands they are set for, or
          not, and come out as normal text.
          This command is a TOGGLE. Meaning, every time you type it, it
          will either turn the option on or off.
