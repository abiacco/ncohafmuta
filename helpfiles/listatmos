 Syntax:  .listatmos

 Result:  Shows the list of atmospheres for the room you are in.
          The format is..
           (atmos_number) <probability> : <message>

          If you see an '@', this acts as a newline/carriage return for
          multiple line atmoses. Wherever the '@' is, the talker will
          continue to show the atmos starting on a new line.
          The max atmospherics than can be saved per room is shown in
          .version (currently 10).
          Atmospherics are messages that show up in rooms at random.
