 Syntax:  .nslookup <ip/number address>

Results:  Use the Unix "nslookup" command to get a site's alpha hostname,
          ip address, and any aliases that go along with it. The first two
          lines outputted are the servers you are getting the info from.
          Following that are the info lines you are seeking. If a lookup
          fails, nothing will be returned.
