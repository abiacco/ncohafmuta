 Syntax:  .gagcomm
          .gagcomm <user> [<time>]

Results:  Makes it so a troublesome user cannot do any private
          communications. This is a milder version of xcomm. This will be
          put on an arrested user by default.
          If used without a user, it will list out all gagcommed users 
          currently logged in.
          A time is optional. If you do not specify a time (in mins), the
          user will be gagcommed until you or someone else ungagcomms
          them. Otherwise, the talker will auto-ungagcomm them after they
          have served <time> online.
          This is a toggle, when used on a user. i.e. if the user is gagcommed
          gagcomming them again, will un-gagcomm them.
