 Syntax:  .set picurl <url_address>

Results:  This command allows you to set your a URL web address to tell the
	  talker where your picture is on the net. The talker will use this to
	  display your picture on the talker web page next to your user info.
	  This is NOT a .html file, but the actual link to your picture file.
	  Like: http://ncohafmuta.com/cygnus/mepics/cygnus.jpg

	  If you have a picture, but it's not on a web page, email it to me at
	  the talker's email address, and i will put it in for you.
