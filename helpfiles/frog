 Syntax:  .frog
          .frog <user> [<time>]

Results:  Makes the user into a frog. Almost any communication that
          comes out of them will be a Ribbit or other frog sound. .says,
          .emotes, .semotes, etc..
          If used without a user, it will list out all frogged users 
          currently logged in.
          A time is optional. If you do not specify a time (in mins), the
          user will be frogged until you or someone else unfrogs them. 
          Otherwise, the talker will auto-unfrog them after they have
          served <time> online.
          This is a toggle, when used on a user. i.e. if the user is frogged
          frogging them again, will un-frog them.
