                     The "How to Get Information" Tutorial

There are quite a few ways to get information about yourself and other
users.

One of those ways is using the ".examine" command.  This command
basically shows you all there is to offer in the world of information
about the specific user. For example, type ".examine jazzin" to see 
Jazzin's info/profile.
For detailed help try ".h examine"

Another command for obtaining information is the ".ustat" command.
This command shows you settings and stats information about the user, 
including, login time, tic-tac-toe wins/losses, hangman wins/losses.  
For example, type ".ustat jazzin" to see Jazzin's user status.
For detailed help try ".h ustat"

The ".wlist" will give you a current, and hopefully, up-to-date list of
all the current wizards/staff that frequent the talker.
Along with this command you want to use the ".wizards" command.
This command will show you what wizards are currently logged on to
the talker.

Another great command to know about is the ".last" command.
The ".last" command will allow you to see the last time a user was
logged into the talker.  
For example: ".last jazzin" will show you the last time Jazzin was logged
in.

The ".log" command will show you the last 10 logins to the talker.
You can see more if you wish by typing ".log <number>"
For example: If you want to see the last 25 logins you type ".log 25"

The ".who" of course, gives you a listing of who is currently on the talker.
A shortened version of this command is the ".swho"

There are many more commands that allow you to obtain information about
yourself as a user and other users, not to mention about the talker
itself.

These are just a few of the main commands that you will use everyday.
For more information on other commands, just type ".h <command>" and you
will be given a detailed help file on that commands syntax and what it
is used for.

You should now read the "How To Change Settings/Info" tutorial by typing
".h settutor"
