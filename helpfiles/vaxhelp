**************************************************************************
NOTICE - Having problems getting into the Talker via direct telnet from 
MAC NCSA telnet.  Try this: 1)Make sure local echo and linemode are 
turned on. 2)Telnet to the talker. 3)When asked for a name, type in your 
name but do not press enter.  Instead turn local echo off.  This will 
simulate an enter for you.  Next turn local echo back on, then enter your 
password.  Again turn local echo off and then back on.  You should now be 
ready to go.  
If you're using verion 2.7 or greater of MAC NCSA TELNET ignore the 
previous and at the name prompt type in your login name, and instead of 
pressing the <return> key, press and hold the <control> then press the 
<n> key then type your password in normally and press <return>
