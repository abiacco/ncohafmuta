 Syntax:  .wlog
          .wlog <user>                  *STAFF ONLY*
          .wlog <user> <reason>         *STAFF ONLY*

Results:  For normal users, let them read their warning log. Things they did 
          wrong, punishments (muzzles,xcomm,gagcomm,etc..)
           The latter syntax allows STAFF to write a log of warnings given to 
          users about shouting, spamming, etc.. This is to keep track of 
          user's misbehavior
           For STAFF not specifying a message, it reads the current warning 
          log that user has on them
