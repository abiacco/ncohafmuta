 Syntax:  .addatmos <probability> <message>

 Result:  Adds an atmospheric to the current room you are in.
          Probability is a number from 1 to 100. <message> can be as long
          as the length shown in .version (now 161) which is 2 lines of
          text plus a @. The @ acts as a newline/carriage return for
          multiple line atmoses. Just put the @ wherever you want for the
          talker to continue showing the atmos starting on a new
          line.
          The max atmospherics than can be saved per room is shown in
          .version (currently 10).
          Atmospherics are messages that show up in rooms at random.
