                     The "How To Communicate" Tutorial

Some of these commands are repeated from the "Basics" tutorial, but it
won't hurt to brush up on them.

To talk to other users in the same room:
       <just type your message>  OR
       .say <message>                         Example: hi, i'm joe

To direct a message at someone in the room:
       .to <user> <message>                   (Everyone will still see it)

To do an emote/action to the room:
       .emote <action>  OR
       ;<action>                              Example: ;jumps on you

To send a private message to someone:
       .tell <user> <message>                 Example: .tell susan Hi

To send a private emote/action to someone:
       .semote <user> <action>                Example: .semote susan hugs you

To shout a message to all users in all rooms:
       .shout <message>

To do an action to all users in all rooms:
       .shemote <action>                      Example: .shemote screams!

To say something to all users in the room EXCEPT <user>:
       .mutter <user> <message>

See the "COMM" section under ".h" for all communication commands available
to you.

You should now read the "Rooms/Moving Around" tutorial by typing 
".h movetutor"
