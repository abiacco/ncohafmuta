 Syntax:  .read
          .read <last # of messages>
          .read <room>
          .read <room> <last # of messages>
          
Results:  Displays the message board of the room you are in.
          If you specify a room name, it will try to read the
          messages written in that room.  If you specify a number at the
          end, it will read that many messages from the bottom of the 
          message board.

Example:  To read the last 5 messages in the current room, type --> .read 5
          To read the last 3 messages in room "Path", type --> .read path 3

  Notes:  If the board is larger than one screen it will be paged
          with the message "** PRESS RETURN **" appearing.  If you
          wish to read more press return, but if you wish to quit
          reading the board press "q" then return.
