 Syntax:  .expire  
          .expire [-e | exempt]
          .expire [-e | exempt] <user>
          .expire -n
          .expire -n <user>

Results:  This command shows you users in the database that haven't been
          used for the specified 'Expiration grace period' in .version
          Also shows you when and from where they last logged in.
          Specifying the -n flag nukes all users that are older that
          the specifed # of days. If <user> is specified, they will
          be exempt from the nuke..Furthermore..
          Specifying the -e or exempt flag by themselves shows the list
          of people exempt from .expire -n..and shows how long ago they
          were last on. Specifying a user after the flag will add or
          delete the user from the exempt list. It's a toggle.
          Along with the command line exempt, you can exempt the MAX users
          on the list + 1 from nuke-expires. It is recommended that you
          look at who is going to be deleted before actually deleting
          them.
          If the administrator wishes, he may set the option which
          will cause the users to be deleted automatically at midnight
          instead of having to type .expire -n
