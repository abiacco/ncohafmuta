 Syntax:  .echo <text>

Results:  Displays a line of text on the screen.  This is displayed by
          itself unlike an .emote or something said.  Your name is not
          placed in front of the message. 
 
   Note:  Wizards can see who echoes a message if they wish to prevent
          abuse. Echoes cannot contain lewd words or begin with the name
          of a person online.
