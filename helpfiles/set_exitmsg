 Syntax:  Alone shows your current message. 
          .set exitmsg <message>        lets you put a message in.
          .set exitmsg [clear|-c|none]  resets to default

Results:  When you walk out a room, instead of "<user> goes to the <room>"
          it shows "<user> <your exitmsg>" If you don't change your
          message from the default it will put the room name you are going
          to at the end.
          This message is saved to disk between logins.
