Results:  This is to write a description for the current room you are in.
          The command works just LIKE the command .entpro in the way it
          works. The description can be up to 10 lines, or whatever the
          current number is in .version. 
          Make sure that you press return after each line you type 
          in.  Remember that each line can only be as long as the screen 
          is.  To finish the description before 10 lines, type a single '.'
          on a line by itself. This will bring up a 4-choice prompt.
          hit 's' to save the description, 'v' to view it, to make sure 
          it's going to appear the way you want it,  'r' to do it all
          over..or hit 'a' to abort whatever you wrote and keep your
          current description. 
   Type1: If you give the -c or clear option, the command will erase
          the room description.
   Type2: Giving a line number and <text> replaces the current text for
          that line in the room description with <text>.
   Type3: Giving a line number and the -b option, makes that line in the
          room description blank. or use the -c option instead to erase that 
          line from the room description.
   Type4: Giving the -i flag and <text> adds <text> to the end of the
          room description. Giving the -i flag and the -b flag adds a blank 
          line to the end of the room description.
   Type5: Giving the -i flag immediately followed by a line number (i.e. 
          -i2) and <text> inserts <text> on a line after <line_number>. 
          Giving -b instead of <text> inserts a blank line after 
          <line_number>
