Using color codes
-----------------
The ANSI color codes can be used almost anywhere in the talker.
All the color codes start with a caret, which is shift-6. If you
just want BOLD text you put a caret before the text you want bold and then
a caret where you want the boldness to stop. If you want it to go right to
the end of the string you are typing an ending caret is NOT necessary.

Colors are done with 2 letter codes. The codes are listed next to the
colors in ".set color test" They go after your first caret, like you're doing
a bold..and then you use the ending caret again where you want the color
to stop.

Other codes are blinking, underline, and reverse video. They're used just
like the color codes.

Examples to say "This is blue" in bold blue to everyone.
.say <caret>HBThisis blue<end caret>
