Results:  Use this command to list all the socials that are available on
          the talker. A social is a action in the list in command format.
          Like the social "hug" is typed as ".hug"
          The syntax for each social is as follows..
            <social> [<user>]
           <user> is optional. If no user is specified, social is directed
          to everyone in the room you are in.
           If <user> IS specified and in the room with you, it will
          emote-directed towards that person.
           If <user> IS specified and NOT in the room with you, it will
          be private emoted (semoted) to them.
           All conditions like gag, invisibility, igtells, etc..
          apply to this command just like with others.
