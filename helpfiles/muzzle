 Syntax:  .muzzle
          .muzzle <user> [<time>]

Results:  Allows you to quiet down users who have been abusing the .shout
          command, where <user> is the person in question.
          If no user is specified, a list of all users with shouts removed
          and logged on users will be displayed.
          A time is optional. If you do not specify a time (in mins), the
          user will be muzzled until you or someone else unmuzzles them.
          Otherwise, the talker will auto-unmuzzle them after they have
          served <time> online.
