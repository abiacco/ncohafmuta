 Syntax:  .set profile
  Type1:  .set profile [clear | -c]
  Type2:  .set profile <line_number> <text>
  Type3:  .set profile <line_number> [-b | -c]
  Type4:  .set profile -i [<text> | -b]
  Type5:  .set profile -i<line_number> [<text> | -b]

Results:  This command allows you to create an up to 10 line (or
          whatever the current number is in .version) profile of
          yourself which can be seen when other users .examine or .ustat
          you.  Make sure that you press return after each line you type 
          in.  Remember that each line can only be as long as the screen 
          is.  To finish the profile before 10 lines, type a single '.'
          on a line by itself. This will bring up a 4-choice prompt.
          hit 's' to save the profile, 'v' to view it, to make sure
          it's going to appear the way you want it,  'r' to do it all
          over..or hit 'a' to abort whatever you wrote and keep your
          current profile. You can combine these two steps into 1 by
          typing the . and <letter> together on a line by itself, as in .s

   Type1: If you give the -c or clear option, the command will erase
          your profile.
   Type2: Giving a line number and <text> replaces the current text for 
          that line in your profile with <text>.
   Type3: Giving a line number and the -b option, makes that line in your 
          profile blank. or use the -c option instead to erase that line
          from your profile.
   Type4: Giving the -i flag and <text> adds <text> to the end of your 
          profile. Giving the -i flag and the -b flag adds a blank line to 
          the end of your profile.
   Type5: Giving the -i flag immediately followed by a line number (i.e. -i2)
          and <text> inserts <text> on a line after <line_number>. Giving 
          -b instead of <text> inserts a blank line after <line_number>
