 Syntax:  .atmos [all | <room_name>]

 Result:  Toggles the talkers atmospherics on or off for rooms.
          If "all" is given as an option, all the room's atmospheres will
          be toggled all on or all off. If a room name is given, it will
          toggle the atmospheres just for that room.
          Atmospherics are messages that show up in rooms at random.
