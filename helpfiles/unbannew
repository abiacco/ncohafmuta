          all the new restricted sites, how long ago they were banned,
          the reason shown to new users that TRY to login from there,
          and the comments for wizzes why the site is new-banned.
          <message> is REQUIRED if -c or -r option is given, and if the
          site is already banned, the site will not be rebanned, just the
          comment/reason added.
          If no option is given, the default reason and comment is used.

          This command creates a possible 3 files in the NEWRESTRICT_DIR
          directory. <ip_address>, <ip_address>.c, <ip_address>.r
          During login access, if a person is attempting to log in
          from a site that has a file in the newrestrict directory, they
          will not be allowed access.

          <ip-address> can have one of four numeric forms..
                a.b.c.d  - Specific IP
                a.b.c    - Cluster
                a.b      - Sub-network
                a        - Network
          and four alpha-numeric forms..
