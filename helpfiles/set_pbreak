 Syntax:  .set pbreak

Results:  This command allows you to set whether the .who list will be
          shown to you to prompted, broken out pages (if it is larger
          than your screen size) or one big list.
          This command is a TOGGLE. Meaning, every time you type it, it
          will either turn the option on or off.
