 Syntax:  .xcomm
          .xcomm <user> [<time>]

Results:  Makes it so a troublesome user cannot do anything except says. 
          This is a command that should be used only for real idiots that
          are causing a lot of problems.
          If used without a user, it will list out all xcommed users 
          currently logged in.
          A time is optional. If you do not specify a time (in mins), the
          user will be xcommed until you or someone else unxcomms them. 
          Otherwise, the talker will auto-unxcomm them after they have
          served <time> online.
          This is a toggle, when used on a user. i.e. if the user is xcommed
          xcomming them again, will un-xcomm them.
