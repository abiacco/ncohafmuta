 Syntax:  .set atmos <countdown> <random factor>

Results:  This command allows you to set the global chancing for all atmos-
          pherics. The atmosphere cycle starts at the number <countdown>.
          This number decreases every minute based on the randomness of
          the <random factor>. 
          The time it takes for any possible atmosphere to appear is a range
          calculated by the equation:
           <countdown> / ( <random factor> + 1 )
	  If the <countdown> is set to 75 and the <random factor> is set to 2
	  the equation is 75 / 2 + 1 or 25. This is the lower end of the range
	  The higher end of the range is simply the countdown number.
          So with these settings, the amount of time it takes for any atmos-
          phere can appear can range from 25 to 75 minutes.
          The default <countdown> is 5. The default <random factor> is 5.
          This gives a range of 1 to 5 minutes.
