 Syntax:  .say <text>  

Results:  This is the same thing as just typing text. Where <text> is what is 
          to be seen.  Selective hilites can also be done by using the ^
          character.

          hilighted
          .say I ^love PinWHeeLs!  come out with "love PinWHeeLs!"
          hilighted
