 Syntax:  .bafk [-l] [<message>]
        
 Result:  Some people call this the boss command.  It is like AFK but
          unlike AFK, all output your your screen is turned off until
          you return.  It will also clear your screen before disabling
          output to it.
          As soon as you type something, it will turn off the BAFK status
          and return you to the normal status.
           IF you use -l option, this will enable the terminal
          locking feature. It will lock your terminal from all input, and
          require you to enter your normal account password to un-lock it.
          Useful when you want to leave the computer unattended, and don't
          want to worry about anyone screwing with it.
           MAKE NOTE that if you type your password incorrectly, you
          will NOT get a password prompt back, since bafk means you're not
          supposed to see anything. Just assume that it's there. If you
          have .set hidden on, your password, when typed, will not echo
          back to you, unlike an .afk -l
          MESSAGES WILL NOT be displayed to your terminal and they are lost.
