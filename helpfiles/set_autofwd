 Syntax:  .set autofwd    (it's a toggle)

Results:  Turns your autoforwarding feature on or off. This is a toggle 
          command and is saved between logins. 
          Autoforwarding toggle options are:
           1. off
              Does not forward your mail at all.
           2. all the time
              Forwards your new mail regardless of whether you are online
              or not.
           3. only when you're not online
              Forwards your new mail only when you're not online/on the
              talker.

          Autoforwarding is the mailing of your NEW talker mail to your
          email address (which you specify with .set email <email>)
          If the address is not valid or you specified no address, the 
          mail will bounce.

   Notes: Just recently, a email per/day limit was imposed since some
          people were doing some bad things to the system. The current
          number of messages you can have auto-forwarded in a day to your
          email address is shown in .version
