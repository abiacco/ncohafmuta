 Syntax:  .tell <user> <message>           ,<user> <message>
          .tell <user,user,user> <message> ,<user,user,user> <message> 
	  .tell -f <message>		   ,-f <message>

Results:  Allows you to tell one or more users something without anyone
	  else being able to see it.  <user> is the person you want to
	  talk to.
          <message> is the message you want to send him/her/them.
	  If you use the -f syntax above, <message> will be sent to all
	  your friends on your .alert list. Works the same as .ftell
          This command also allows you to review your tells if you do not
          specify anything after the .tell command.
          If you do NOT specify a message, it will send to the user(s)..
          "You sense that <your name> is looking for you in <your_room>"
          while still applying to vis/invis conditions.

Example:  To tell 'cygnus' "hi": .tell cygnus hi  or  
                                 ,cygnus hi       or
                                 ,cyg hi
	  To tell 'cygnus' and 'rager' hi: .tell cygnus,rager hi  or
					   ,cygnus,rager hi       or
					   ,cyg,rag hi
          To review your tells: .tell

  NOTES:  Spaces can be placed in between user combinations w/commas.
	  i.e. .tell cygnus, rager hi
	       .tell cygnus , rager hi
          You can tell to as many as MAX_MULTIS simultaneous people
          Default is 10
