 Syntax:  .shutdown -c
          .shutdown [<num_of_minutes>]
          .shutdown [-r|-h] [<num_of_minutes>]

Results:  Shuts the talker down or reboots it.  It will ask if you really
          want to do this, just in case you accidentally type .shutdown.
          It will quit all users before going down. The "-c" string after
          the command is used to cancel an auto-shutdown/reboot.
          An auto-shutdown is done by specifying a number from 1-32766
          after the shutdown command.

	  If the -r option is specified, this will perform a SOFT-reboot.
	  A soft-reboot will reboot the binary without disconnecting
	  the users or losing their current information (I guess you could call
	  it hot-rebooting)
          If a number from 1-32766 is specified after the -r option, the talker will
	  SOFT-reboot after that many minutes. Without a number specified, the talk soft-reboots
	  immediately.

	  If the -h option is specified, this will perform a HARD-reboot.
	  A hard-reboot will reboot the binary, disconnecting the users and exiting
	  the previous system.
          If a number from 1-32766 is specified after the -h option, the talker will
	  HARD-reboot after that many minutes. Without a number specified, the talk hard-reboots
	  immediately.

Example:  To have the talker shut itself down in 3 hours,
          type --> .shutdown 180

  Notes:  On auto-shutdowns/reboots, broadcasts will be given by the
          talker automatically to let you and the other users know how
          long before it will shutdown/reboot. No users need to be online
          for an auto-shutdown or auto-reboot to take place.
