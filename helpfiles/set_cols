 Syntax:  .set cols <# of columns>

Results:  This command allows you to set which column on your screen the
          talker will wrap the text to the next line. The default is 256.
          Valid values are 16 to 256.
          If you needed the system to perform line wrapping for a screen
          that is 80 characters acress, you would type: .set cols 80

  Notes:  DO NOT CHANGE THE COLS UNLESS YOU NEED TO. (ie. .set cols 80)
          This will reduce you responsiveness and may cause additional 
          lag for you.
