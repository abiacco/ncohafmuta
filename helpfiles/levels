                  ^HR** Talker Level/Rank Structure **^

The talker has 5 levels.
From lowest to highest: Newbie, Wheeler, Wizard, Manager, and Admin.
Here's a brief description and what's expected at each level.

^HBNewbie^:  Exactly as it says ;)  Anyone that's new to the talker.  If you are at
         this level, and are familiar with talkers in general, you can easily
         get promoted by setting your desc, entpro, and gender.  Once these
         attributes are set, the talker will automatically promote you to the
         next level. You need not wait around for a manager or higher to promote
         you :)

^HGWheeler^: The equivalant of a regular user.  Most everyone will be at this level 
         unless it's found necessary to bring up someone up to wizard.  Users 
         that are helpful and courteous to all users regardless of their rank
         are the ones that will be considered for further promotion.

^HYWizard^:  These people are here to help police the talker and help new users.
         They have a working knowledge of the commands and have the ability to 
         handle prohibited behavior.  These are the ones that are most likely 
         to bust your butt if you don't play nice ;)

^HRManager^: These people are the backbone of the talker, handling administrative 
         decisions. These are the ones that handle user complaints, deal with 
         repeated troublesome users, decide possible promotions/demotions and 
         handle other misc talker business.

^HMAdmin^:   This is reserved for owners only.


                        ^HR** Promotions **^

Like mentioned in the .faq, we do *not* discourage asking for a 
promotion.  However, please do not be offended if the answer is "no".  
99.9% of the time, a "no" answer is simply because we have no need
for more people at those levels.  Promotions to levels above Wheeler are
decided by mutual discussion among all Managers with input from other 
users.  Remember that repeated asking about a promotion not only causes
problems for the Managers, but can seriously reduce your chances of becoming
a Wizard.  Taken too far (continued asking after being asked to stop asking)
can result in demotion.  

Managers and higher are the only levels that can promote. So, if you feel a 
need to inquire about a promotion, please either ask someone at these levels,
or leave a message on the .gripe board.  The .gripe board will no longer be 
anonymous, so there is no need to sign your name and only Managers and higher 
can read it.
