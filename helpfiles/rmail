 Syntax:  .rmail
          .rmail -s
          .rmail <number of messages>

Results:  Allows you to read your system mail. If you specify a number at
          the end of the command, you can read that many messages from the
          bottom of your mailfile. If you give a number greater than the
          number of messages you have in your file, the whole file will be
          shown. If you give the -s flag, the system will show you how
          much mail diskspace you have and are currently using.
          Remeber that if you go over the limit, you will not be able to
          receive mail until you delete some of it.

Example:  To read the last 4 messages in your mail file, type --> .rmail 4
