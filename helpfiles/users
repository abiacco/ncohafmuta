Syntax :  .users [<search string>|-n]

Results:  .users will display a list of all current users if no search 
          string is supplied.  If a search string is supplied, all names 
          with the search string in it will be displayed. If the search string supplied
	  is the option "-n", then the command will just return the number of users
	  counted, instead of printing out the items themselves.

External Influences:

          Only current users are in this directory.

Example:  To see a listing of users containing "jo", type:  .users jo
