 Syntax:  .greet <text>

Results:  Displays up to 10 alphabetic characters in banner format.  
          <text> is the string you want to have displayed.

   Note:  Spaces, numbers, and non-alphabetic characters will not
          be displayed by the .greet command.  Also, continued
          usage of the .greet command can be annoying to other
          users, so please use this command in moderation.
