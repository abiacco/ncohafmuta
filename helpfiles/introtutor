                        The "Introduction" Tutorial

Welcome to a "talker"
The game's user interface consists entirely of textual descriptions of rooms, 
players, and exits.
No mouse interaction is required. No sound, video, or graphics are present.
All interaction with the talker is done via the keyboard.

There is no object to the game other than to wander around and socially
interact with other users.

Communication with other users is usually public, but can be private by
sending private 'tells' between users, or by those users moving into a 
private room by themselves and then communicating.

Structure on the talker is created by a series of connected virtual rooms.
They are the basic places for conversation. Most are public, and some can be
made private by the users.
Messages sent to a room, by a user, are seen by all users in that room.
Once in a room you will be presented with the name of the room, a description
of the room, exits from the room to other rooms, what other users are in the
room, and other misc info.
In each room is a message board which is freely readable and writeable by 
users. These can be used from anything ranging from announcements to jokes to
random ramblings.
Another form of communication on the talker is an internal mail system,
used to communicate with users that aren't currently 'logged on'.

Users can personalize their character by entering information about 
themselves for others to see. Such information includes a profile, their
email address, webpage, and icq #. This information is voluntary.

All input is through a command system. All commands start with a 
period (.) For example, the ".who" command tells you who is 
logged on to the talker.

To log out of the talker, i.e. disconnect, use the ".quit" command

You should now read the "Getting Started" tutorial by typing ".h jointutor"
